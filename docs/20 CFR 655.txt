§655.0 Scope and purpose of part.
(a) Subparts A, B, and C—(1) General. Subparts A, B, and C of this part set out the procedures adopted by the
Secretary to secure information sufficient to make factual determinations of: (i) Whether U.S. workers are available
to perform temporary employment in the United States, for which an employer desires to employ nonimmigrant
foreign workers, and (ii) whether the employment of aliens for such temporary work will adversely affect the wages
or working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. These factual determinations (or a determination that
there are not sufficient facts to make one or both of these determinations) are required to carry out the policies of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), that a nonimmigrant alien worker not be admitted to fill a particular
temporary job opportunity unless no qualifed U.S. worker is available to fill the job opportunity, and unless the
employment of the foreign worker in the job opportunity will not adversely affect the wages or working conditions
of similarly employed U.S. workers.
(2) The Secretary's determinations. Before any factual determination can be made concerning the availability
of U.S. workers to perform particular job opportunities, two steps must be taken. First, the minimum level of wages,
terms, benefits, and conditions for the particular job opportunities, below which similarly employed U.S. workers
would be adversely affected, must be established. (The regulations in this part establish such minimum levels for
wages, terms, benefits, and conditions of employment.) Second, the wages, terms, benefits, and conditions offered
and afforded to the aliens must be compared to the established minimum levels. If it is concluded that adverse effect
would result, the ultimate determination of availability within the meaning of the INA cannot be made since U.S.
workers cannot be expected to accept employment under conditions below the established minimum levels. Florida
Sugar Cane League, Inc. v. Usery, 531 F. 2d 299 (5th Cir. 1976).

Once a determination of no adverse effect has been made, the availability of U.S. workers can be tested only if U.S.
workers are actively recruited through the offer of wages, terms, benefits, and conditions at least at the minimum
level or the level offered to the aliens, whichever is higher. The regulations in this part set forth requirements for
recruiting U.S. workers in accordance with this principle.
(3) Construction. This part and its subparts shall be construed to effectuate the purpose of the INA that U.S.
workers rather than aliens be employed wherever possible. Elton Orchards, Inc. v. Brennan, 508 F. 2d 493, 500 (1st
Cir. 1974), Flecha v. Quiros, 567 F. 2d 1154 (1st Cir. 1977). Where temporary alien workers are admitted, the terms
and conditions of their employment must not result in a lowering of the terms and conditions of domestic workers
similarly employed, Williams v. Usery, 531 F. 2d 305 (5th Cir. 1976); Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc. v. Usery,
531 F. 2d 299 (5th Cir. 1976), and the job benefits extended to any U.S. workers shall be at least those extended to
the alien workers.
(b) Subparts D and E. Subparts D and E of this part set forth the process by which health care facilities can
file attestations with the Department of Labor for the purpose of employing or otherwise using nonimmigrant
registered nurses under H-1A visas.
(c) Subparts F and G. Subparts F and G of this part set forth the process by which employers can file
attestations with the Department of Labor for the purpose of employing alien crewmembers in longshore work under
D-visas and enforcement provisions relating thereto.
(d) Subparts H and I of this part. Subpart H of this part sets forth the process by which employers can file
labor condition applications (LCAs) with, and the requirements for obtaining approval from, the Department of
Labor to temporarily employ the following three categories of nonimmigrants in the United States: (1) H-1B visas
for temporary employment in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability; (2) H1B1 visas for temporary employment in specialty occupations of nonimmigrant professionals from countries with
which the United States has entered into certain agreements identified in section 214(g)(8)(A) of the INA; and (3) E3 visas for nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia for temporary employment in specialty occupations. Subpart
I of this part establishes the enforcement provisions that apply to the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visa programs.
(e) Subparts J and K of this part. Subparts J and K of this part set forth the process by which employers can
file attestations with the Department of Labor for the purpose of employing nonimmigrant alien students on F-visas
in off-campus employment and enforcement provisions relating thereto.

§655.00 Authority of the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) Administrator under subparts A, B,
and C.
Pursuant to the regulations under this part, temporary labor certification determinations under subparts A, B,
and C of this part are ordinarily made by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) Administrator (OFLC
Administrator) of the Employment and Training Administration. The OFLC Administrator will informally advise
the employer or agent of the name of the official who will make determinations with respect to the application.

Subpart A—Labor Certification Process and Enforcement of Attestations for
Temporary Employment in Occupations Other Than Agriculture or Registered
Nursing in the United States (H-2B Workers)
SOURCE: 73 FR 78052, Dec. 19, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

§655.1 Scope and purpose of subpart A.
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) at 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1) requires the Secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) to consult with appropriate agencies before authorizing the entry of H-2B workers.
DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv) provide that an employer's petition to employ nonimmigrant workers on
H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural employment in the United States (U.S.), except for Guam, must be
accompanied by an approved temporary labor certification from the Secretary of Labor (Secretary).
(a) Purpose. The temporary labor certification reflects a determination by the Secretary that:

PREFILING PROCEDURES
§655.10 Determination of prevailing wage for temporary labor certification purposes.

(a) Offered wage. The employer must advertise the position to all potential workers at a wage at least equal to
the prevailing wage obtained from the NPWC, or the Federal, State or local minimum wage, whichever is highest.
The employer must offer and pay this wage (or higher) to both its H-2B workers and its workers in corresponding
employment. The issuance of a PWD under this section does not permit an employer to pay a wage lower than the
highest wage required by any applicable Federal, State or local law.
(b) Determinations. Prevailing wages shall be determined as follows:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the job opportunity is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement (CBA) that was negotiated at arms' length between the union and the employer, the wage rate
set forth in the CBA is considered as not adversely affecting the wages of U.S. workers, that is, it is considered the
“prevailing wage” for labor certification purposes.
(2) If the job opportunity is not covered by a CBA, the prevailing wage for labor certification purposes shall
be the arithmetic mean, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, of the wages of workers similarly
employed in the area of intended employment. The wage component of the BLS Occupational Employment
Statistics Survey (OES) shall be used to determine the arithmetic mean, unless the employer provides a survey
acceptable to OFLC under paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) If the job opportunity involves multiple worksites within an area of intended employment and different
prevailing wage rates exist for the same opportunity and staff level within the area of intended employment, the
prevailing wage shall be based on the highest applicable wage among all relevant worksites.
(4) If the employer provides a survey acceptable under paragraph (f) of this section that provides a median but
does not provide an arithmetic mean, the prevailing wage applicable to the employer's job opportunity shall be the
median of the wages of U.S. workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment.
(5) The employer may use a current wage determination in the area determined under the Davis-Bacon Act, 40
U.S.C. 276a et seq., 29 CFR part 1, or the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.
(6) The NPC will enter its wage determination on the form it uses for these purposes, indicate the source, and
return the form with its endorsement to the employer within 30 days of receipt of the request for a prevailing wage
determination. The employer must offer this wage (or higher) to both its H-2B workers and any similarly employed
U.S. worker hired in response to the recruitment required as part of the application.
(c) Request for PWD. (1) An employer must request and receive a PWD from the NPWC before filing the job
order with the SWA.
(2) The PWD must be valid on the date the job order is posted.
(d) Multiple worksites. If the job opportunity involves multiple worksites within an area of intended
employment and different prevailing wage rates exist for the opportunity within the area of intended employment,
the prevailing wage is the highest applicable wage among all the worksites.
(e) NPWC action. The NPWC will provide the PWD, indicate the source, and return the Application for
Prevailing Wage Determination (ETA Form 9141) with its endorsement to the employer.
(f) Employer-provided wage information. (1) If the job opportunity is not covered by a CBA, or by a
professional sports league's rules or regulations, the NPC will consider wage information provided by the employer
in making a Prevailing Wage Determination. An employer survey can be submitted either initially or after NPC
issuance of a PWD derived from the OES survey.

(2) In each case where the employer submits a survey or other wage data for which it seeks acceptance, the
employer must provide specific information about the survey methodology, including such items as sample size and
source, sample selection procedures, and survey job descriptions, to allow a determination of the adequacy of the
data provided and validity of the statistical methodology used in conducting the survey in accordance with guidance
issued by the OFLC national office.
(3) The survey must be based upon recently collected data:
(i) Any published survey must have been published within 24 months of the date of submission, must be the
most current edition of the survey, and must be based on data collected not more than 24 months before the
publication date.
(ii) A survey conducted by the employer must be based on data collected within 24 months of the date it is
submitted for consideration.
(4) If the employer-provided survey is found not to be acceptable, the NPC shall inform the employer in
writing of the reasons the survey was not accepted.
(5) The employer, after receiving notification that the survey it provided for consideration is not acceptable,
may file supplemental information as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, file a new request for a PWD, appeal
under §655.11, or, if the initial PWD was requested prior to submission of the employer survey, acquiesce to the
initial PWD.
(g) Submission of supplemental information by employer. (1) If the employer disagrees with the wage level
assigned to its job opportunity, or if the NPC informs the employer its survey is not acceptable, or if there is another
legitimate basis for such a review, the employer may submit supplemental information to the NPC.
(2) The NPC must consider one supplemental submission relating to the employer's survey, the skill level
assigned to the job opportunity, or any other legitimate basis for the employer to request such a review. If the NPC
does not accept the employer's survey after considering the supplemental information, or affirms its determination
concerning the skill level, the NPC must inform the employer, in writing, of the reasons for its decision.
(3) The employer may then apply for a new wage determination, appeal under §655.11, or acquiesce to the
initial PWD.
(h) Validity period. The NPWC must specify the validity period of the prevailing wage, which in no event may
be more than 365 days and no less than 90 days from the date that the determination is issued.
(i) Professional athletes. In computing the prevailing wage for a professional athlete when the job opportunity
is covered by professional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in those rules or regulations is
considered the prevailing wage. 8 U.S.C. 1182(p)(2).
(h) The prevailing wage cannot be lower than required by any other law. No PWD for labor certification
purposes made under this section permits an employer to pay a wage lower than the highest wage required by any
applicable Federal, State, or local law.
(i) Retention of documentation. The employer must retain the PWD for 3 years and submitted to a CO in the
event it is requested in an RFI or an audit or to a Wage and Hour representative in the event of a Wage and Hour
investigation.
(j) Retention of documentation. The employer must retain the PWD for 3 years from the date of issuance or the
date of a final determination on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, whichever is later, and

submit it to a CO if requested by a Notice of Deficiency, described in §655.31, or audit, as described in §655.70, or
to a WHD representative during a WHD investigation.
(k) Guam. The requirements of this paragraph apply to any request filed for an H-2B job opportunity on

§655.10 Determination of prevailing wage for temporary labor certification purposes.
* * * * *
(b) Basis for prevailing wage determinations. The prevailing wage is the highest of the following:
(1) The wage rate set forth in the CBA, if the job opportunity is covered by a CBA that was negotiated at arms'
length between the union and the employer;
(2) The wage rate established under the DBA or SCA for the occupation in the area of intended employment if
the job opportunity is in an occupation for which such a wage rate has been determined; or
(3) The arithmetic mean of the wages of workers similarly employed in the occupation in the area of intended
employment as determined by the OES. This computation will be based on the arithmetic mean wage of all workers
in the occupation.
* * * * *
(6) In geographic areas where the OES does not gather wage data, including but not limited to the jurisdiction
of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and there is no CBA, DBA, or SCA wage available for the
job opportunity, the NPC will consider wage information in the form of a wage survey provided by an employer in
making a prevailing wage determination. Such a survey may only be submitted with a request for a prevailing wage
determination. A request filed under this paragraph does not need to be preceded by a request and approval to
submit wage information as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(7)(i) An employer may submit a written request to the Administrator, OFLC to provide a private wage survey
for OFLC to consider in making a prevailing wage determination which must demonstrate that the following factors
are present:
(A) There is no CBA, DBA, or SCA wage available for the job opportunity;
(B) The job opportunity was not listed in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and is not listed in the
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, or if the job opportunity was listed in the DOT or is listed in
the SOC system, the DOT crosswalk to the SOC system links to an occupational classification signifying a
generalized set of occupations as “all other”; and

(C) The job description entails job duties which require knowledge, skills, abilities, and work tasks that are
significantly different, as defined in guidance to be issued by the OFLC, than those in any other SOC occupation.
(ii) The Administrator, OFLC may approve or deny an employer's written request to provide a wage survey. If
the Administrator, OFLC approves the employer's written request, the Administrator, OFLC will send an approval
letter to the employer. Approvals shall be valid for 1 year from the date of approval and only for the job opportunity
and area of intended employment specified in the original written request. This approval does not constitute an
acceptance of any particular wage survey.
(iii) If approval is granted, the employer may submit a request for a prevailing wage determination to the NPC
along with a copy of the Administrator, OFLC's approval letter and a complete copy of the private survey. The NPC
will evaluate the adequacy of the data provided and validity of the statistical methodology used in conducting the
survey in accordance with guidance issued by the OFLC National Office.
(iv) In each case where the employer submits a wage survey for which it seeks acceptance, the employer must
provide specific information about the survey methodology, including such items as sample size and source, sample
selection procedures, and survey job descriptions, to allow a determination of the adequacy of the data provided and
validity of the statistical methodology used in conducting the survey in accordance with guidance issued by the
OFLC National Office.
(v) The survey must be based upon recently collected data:
(A) Any published survey must have been published within 24 months of the date of submission, must be the
most current edition of the survey, and must be based on data collected not more than 24 months before the
publication date.
(B) A survey conducted by the employer must be based on data collected within 24 months of the date it is
submitted for consideration.
(vi) The survey cannot as any part of its data wage information reflect the wages of H-2B workers or other
nonimmigrant workers.
(vii) If the NPC does not approve the survey for use in the H-2B program, the NPC shall inform the employer
in writing of the reasons the survey was not accepted. An employer may appeal the NPC's decision in accordance
with §655.11.
§655.11 Registration of H-2B employers.
All employers that desire to hire H-2B workers must establish their need for services or labor is temporary by
filing an H-2B Registration with the Chicago NPC.
(a) Registration filing. An employer must file an H-2B Registration. The H-2B Registration must be
accompanied by documentation evidencing:
(1) The number of positions that will be sought in the first year of registration;
(2) The time period of need for the workers requested;
(3) That the nature of the employer's need for the services or labor to be performed is non-agricultural and
temporary, and is justified as either a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, or an intermittent need,
as defined at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) and §655.6 (or in the case of job contractors, a seasonal need or one-time
occurrence); and

(4) For job contractors, the job contractor's own seasonal need or one-time occurrence, such as through the
provision of payroll records.
(b) Original signature. The H-2B Registration must bear the original signature of the employer (and that of the
employer's attorney or agent if applicable). If and when the H-2B Registration is permitted to be filed electronically,
the employer will satisfy this requirement by signing the H-2B Registration as directed by the CO.
(c) Timeliness of registration filing. A completed request for an H-2B Registration must be received by no less
than 120 calendar days and no more than 150 calendar days before the employer's date of need, except where the
employer submits the H-2B Registration in support of an emergency filing under §655.17.
(d) Temporary need. (1) The employer must establish that its need for non-agricultural services or labor is
temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job is permanent or temporary. 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(A). A job
contractor must also demonstrate through documentation its own seasonal need or one-time occurrence.
(2) The employer's need will be assessed in accordance with the definitions provided by the Secretary of DHS
and as further defined in §655.6.
(e) NPC review. The CO will review the H-2B Registration and its accompanying documentation for
completeness and make a determination based on the following factors:
(1) The job classification and duties qualify as non-agricultural;
(2) The employer's need for the services or labor to be performed is temporary in nature, and for job
contractors, demonstration of the job contractor's own seasonal need or one-time occurrence;
(3) The number of worker positions and period of need are justified; and
(4) The request represents a bona fide job opportunity.
(f) Mailing and postmark requirements. Any notice or request pertaining to an H-2B Registration sent by the
CO to an employer requiring a response will be mailed to the address provided on the H-2B Registration using
methods to assure next day delivery, including electronic mail. The employer's response to the notice or request
must be mailed using methods to assure next day delivery, including electronic mail, and be sent by the due date
specified by the CO or by the next business day if the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday.
(g) Request for information (RFI). If the CO determines the H-2B Registration cannot be approved, the CO
will issue an RFI. The RFI will be issued within 7 business days of the CO's receipt of the H-2B Registration. The
RFI will:
(1) State the reason(s) why the H-2B Registration cannot be approved and what supplemental information or
documentation is needed to correct the deficiencies;
(2) Specify a date, no later than 7 business days from the date the RFI is issued, by which the supplemental
information or documentation must be sent by the employer;
(3) State that, upon receipt of a response to the RFI, the CO will review the H-2B Registration as well as any
supplemental information and documentation and issue a Notice of Decision on the H-2B Registration. The CO
may, at his or her discretion, issue one or more additional RFIs before issuing a Notice of Decision on the H-2B
Registration; and
(4) State that failure to comply with an RFI, including not responding in a timely manner or not providing all
required documentation within the specified timeframe, will result in a denial of the H-2B Registration.

(h) Notice of Decision. The CO will notify the employer in writing of the final decision on the H-2B
Registration.
(1) Approved H-2B Registration. If the H-2B Registration is approved, the CO will send a Notice of Decision
to the employer, and a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of Decision will notify the
employer that it is eligible to seek H-2B workers in the occupational classification for the anticipated number of
positions and period of need stated on the approved H-2B Registration. The CO may approve the H-2B Registration
for a period of up to 3 consecutive years.
(2) Denied H-2B Registration. If the H-2B Registration is denied, the CO will send a Notice of Decision to the
employer, and a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of Decision will:
(i) State the reason(s) why the H-2B Registration is denied;
(ii) Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review under §655.61 within 10 business days
from the date the Notice of Decision is issued and state that if the employer does not request administrative review
within that period the denial is final.
(i) Retention of documents. All employers filing an H-2B Registration are required to retain any documents
and records not otherwise submitted proving compliance with this subpart. Such records and documents must be
retained for a period of 3 years from the date of certification of the last Application for Temporary Employment
Certification supported by the H-2B Registration, if approved, or 3 years from the date the decision is issued if the
H-2B Registration is denied or 3 years from the day the Department receives written notification from the employer
withdrawing its pending H-2B Registration.
(j) Transition period. In order to allow OFLC to make the necessary changes to its program operations to
accommodate the new registration process, OFLC will announce in the FEDERAL REGISTER a separate transition
period for the registration process, and until that time, will continue to adjudicate temporary need during the
processing of applications.

§655.14 [Reserved]

APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION FILING
PROCEDURES
§655.15 Application filing requirements.
All registered employers that desire to hire H-2B workers must file an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification with the NPC designated by the Administrator, OFLC. Except for employers that qualify for
emergency procedures at §655.17, employers that fail to register under the procedures in §655.11 and/or that fail to
submit a PWD obtained under §655.10 will not be eligible to file an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification and their applications will be returned without review.
(a) What to file. A registered employer seeking H-2B workers must file a completed Application for
Temporary Employment Certification (ETA Form 9142 and the appropriate appendices and valid PWD), a copy of
the job order being submitted concurrently to the SWA serving the area of intended employment, as set forth in
§655.16, and copies of all contracts and agreements with any agent and/or recruiter, executed in connection with the
job opportunities and all information required, as specified in §§655.8 and 655.9.
(b) Timeliness. A completed Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be filed no more than
90 calendar days and no less than 75 calendar days before the employer's date of need.

(c) Location and method of filing. The employer must submit the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification and all required supporting documentation to the NPC. At a future date the Department may also
permit an Application for Temporary Employment Certification to be filed electronically in addition to or instead of
by mail. Notice of such procedure will be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
(d) Original signature. The Application for Temporary Employment Certification must bear the original
signature of the employer (and that of the employer's authorized attorney or agent if the employer is so represented).
If and when an Application for Temporary Employment Certification is permitted to be filed electronically, the
employer will satisfy this requirement by signing the Application for Temporary Employment Certification as
directed by the CO.
(e) Requests for multiple positions. Certification of more than one position may be requested on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification as long as all H-2B workers will perform the same services or
labor under the same terms and conditions, in the same occupation, in the same area of intended employment, and
during the same period of employment.
(f) Separate applications. Only one Application for Temporary Employment Certification may be filed for
worksite(s) within one area of intended employment for each job opportunity with an employer for each period of
employment. Except where otherwise permitted under §655.4, an association or other organization of employers is
not permitted to file master applications on behalf of its employer-members under the H-2B program.
(g) One-time occurrence. Where a one-time occurrence lasts longer than 1 year, the CO will instruct the
employer on any additional recruitment requirements with respect to the continuing validity of the labor market test
or offered wage obligation.
(h) Information dissemination. Information received in the course of processing a request for an H-2B
Registration, an Application for Temporary Employment Certification or program integrity measures such as audits
may be forwarded from OFLC to WHD, or any other Federal agency as appropriate, for investigative and/or
enforcement purposes.
[77 FR 10153, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.16 Filing of the job order at the SWA.
(a) Submission of the job order. (1) The employer must submit the job order to the SWA serving the area of
intended employment at the same time it submits the Application for Temporary Employment Certification and a
copy of the job order to the NPC in accordance with §655.15. If the job opportunity is located in more than one State
within the same area of intended employment, the employer may submit the job order to any one of the SWAs
having jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites, but must identify the receiving SWA on the copy of the job order
submitted to the NPC with its Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The employer must inform the
SWA that the job order is being placed in connection with a concurrently submitted Application for Temporary
Employment Certification for H-2B workers.
(2) In addition to complying with State-specific requirements governing job orders, the job order submitted to
the SWA must satisfy the requirements set forth in §655.18.
(b) SWA review of the job order. The SWA must review the job order and ensure that it complies with criteria
set forth in §655.18. If the SWA determines that the job order does not comply with the applicable criteria, the SWA
must inform the CO at the NPC of the noted deficiencies within 6 business days of receipt of the job order.
(c) Intrastate and interstate clearance. Upon receipt of the Notice of Acceptance, as described in §655.33, the
SWA must promptly place the job order in intrastate clearance and provide to other states as directed by the CO.

(d) Duration of job order posting and SWA referral of U.S. workers. Upon receipt of the Notice of
Acceptance, any SWA in receipt of the employer's job order must keep the job order on its active file until the end
of the recruitment period, as set forth in §655.40(c), and must refer to the employer in a manner consistent with
§655.47 all qualified U.S. workers who apply for the job opportunity or on whose behalf a job application is made.
(e) Amendments to a job order. The employer may amend the job order at any time before the CO makes a
final determination, in accordance with procedures set forth in §655.35.
[77 FR 10154, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.17 Emergency situations.
(a) Waiver of time period. The CO may waive the time period(s) for filing an H-2B Registration and/or an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification for employers that have good and substantial cause, provided
that the CO has sufficient time to thoroughly test the domestic labor market on an expedited basis and to make a
final determination as required by §655.50.
(b) Employer requirements. The employer requesting a waiver of the required time period(s) must submit to
the NPC a request for a waiver of the time period requirement, a completed Application for Temporary Employment
Certification and the proposed job order identifying the SWA serving the area of intended employment, and must
otherwise meet the requirements of §655.15. If the employer did not previously apply for an H-2B Registration, the
employer must also submit a completed H-2B Registration with all supporting documentation, as required by
§655.11. If the employer did not previously apply for a PWD, the employer must also submit a completed PWD
request. The employer's waiver request must include detailed information describing the good and substantial cause
that has necessitated the waiver request. Good and substantial cause may include, but is not limited to, the
substantial loss of U.S. workers due to Acts of God, or a similar unforeseeable man-made catastrophic event (such
as an oil spill or controlled flooding) that is wholly outside of the employer's control, unforeseeable changes in
market conditions, or pandemic health issues. A denial of a previously submitted H-2B Registration in accordance
with the procedures set forth in §655.11 does not constitute good and substantial cause necessitating a waiver under
this section.
(c) Processing of emergency applications. The CO will process the emergency H-2B Registration and/or
Application for Temporary Employment Certification and job order in a manner consistent with the provisions of
this subpart and make a determination on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in accordance
with §655.50. If the CO grants the waiver request, the CO will forward a Notice of Acceptance and the approved job
order to the SWA serving the area of intended employment identified by the employer in the job order. If the CO
determines that the certification cannot be granted because, under paragraph (a) of this section, the request for
emergency filing is not justified and/or there is not sufficient time to make a determination of temporary need or
ensure compliance with the criteria for certification contained in §655.51, the CO will send a Final Determination
letter to the employer in accordance with §655.53.
[77 FR 10154, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.18 Job order assurances and contents.
(a) General. Each job order placed in connection with an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification must at a minimum include the information contained in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, by
submitting the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, an employer agrees to comply with the
following assurances with respect to each job order:
(1) Prohibition against preferential treatment. The employer's job order must offer to U.S. workers no less than
the same benefits, wages, and working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to
H-2B workers. Job offers may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or obligations that will not be imposed
on the employer's H-2B workers. This does not relieve the employer from providing to H-2B workers at least the

minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions which must be offered to U.S. workers consistent with this
section.
(2) Bona fide job requirements. Each job qualification and requirement must be listed in the job order and
must be bona fide and consistent with the normal and accepted qualifications and requirements imposed by non-H2B employers in the same occupation and area of intended employment.
(b) Contents. In addition to complying with the assurances in paragraph (a) of this section, the employer's job
order must meet the following requirements:
(1) State the employer's name and contact information;
(2) Indicate that the job opportunity is a temporary, full-time position, including the total number of job
openings the employer intends to fill;
(3) Describe the job opportunity for which certification is sought with sufficient information to apprise U.S.
workers of the services or labor to be performed, including the duties, the minimum education and experience
requirements, the work hours and days, and the anticipated start and end dates of the job opportunity;
(4) Indicate the geographic area of intended employment with enough specificity to apprise applicants of any
travel requirements and where applicants will likely have to reside to perform the services or labor;
(5) Specify the wage that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H-2B workers, or, in the
event that there are multiple wage offers (such as where an itinerary is authorized through special procedures for an
employer), the range of wage offers, and ensure that the wage offer equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing
wage or the Federal, State, or local minimum wage;
(6) If applicable, specify that overtime will be available to the worker and the wage offer(s) for working any
overtime hours;
(7) If applicable, state that on-the-job training will be provided to the worker;
(8) State that the employer will use a single workweek as its standard for computing wages due;
(9) Specify the frequency with which the worker will be paid, which must be at least every 2 weeks or
according to the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment, whichever is more frequent;
(10) If the employer provides the worker with the option of board, lodging, or other facilities, including fringe
benefits, or intends to assist workers to secure such lodging, disclose the provision and cost of the board, lodging, or
other facilities, including fringe benefits or assistance to be provided;
(11) State that the employer will make all deductions from the worker's paycheck required by law. Specify any
deductions the employer intends to make from the worker's paycheck which are not required by law, including, if
applicable, any deductions for the reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities;
(12) Detail how the worker will be provided with or reimbursed for transportation and subsistence from the
place from which the worker has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad, to the place of
employment, if the worker completes 50 percent of the period of employment covered by the job order, consistent
with §655.20(j)(1)(i);
(13) State that the employer will provide or pay for the worker's cost of return transportation and daily
subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening
employment, departed to work for the employer, if the worker completes the certified period of employment or is

dismissed from employment for any reason by the employer before the end of the period, consistent with
§655.20(j)(1)(ii);
(14) If applicable, state that the employer will provide daily transportation to and from the worksite;
(15) State that the employer will reimburse the H-2B worker in the first workweek for all visa, visa
processing, border crossing, and other related fees, including those mandated by the government, incurred by the H2B worker (but need not include passport expenses or other charges primarily for the benefit of the worker);
(16) State that the employer will provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all tools, supplies,
and equipment required to perform the duties assigned, in accordance with §655.20(k);
(17) State the applicability of the three-fourths guarantee, offering the worker employment for a total number
of work hours equal to at least three-fourths of the workdays of each 12-week period, if the period of employment
covered by the job order is 120 or more days, or each 6-week period, if the period of employment covered by the job
order is less than 120 days, in accordance with §655.20(f); and
(18) Instruct applicants to inquire about the job opportunity or send applications, indications of availability,
and/or resumes directly to the nearest office of the SWA in the State in which the advertisement appeared and
include the SWA contact information.
[77 FR 10154, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.19 Job contractor filing requirements.
(a) Provided that a job contractor and any employer-client are joint employers, a job contractor may submit an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification on behalf of itself and that employer-client.
(b) A job contractor must have separate contracts with each different employer-client. Each contract or
agreement may support only one Application for Temporary Employment Certification for each employer-client job
opportunity within a single area of intended employment.
(c) Either the job contractor or its employer-client may submit an ETA Form 9141, Application for Prevailing
Wage Determination, describing the job opportunity to the NPWC. However, each of the joint employers is
separately responsible for ensuring that the wage offer listed on the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, ETA Form 9142, and related recruitment at least equals the prevailing wage rate determined by the
NPWC and that all other wage obligations are met.
(d)(1) A job contractor that is filing as a joint employer with its employer-client must submit to the NPC a
completed Application for Temporary Employment Certification, ETA Form 9142, that clearly identifies the joint
employers (the job contractor and its employer-client) and the employment relationship (including the actual
worksite), in accordance with the instructions provided by the Department. The Application for Temporary
Employment Certification must bear the original signature of the job contractor and the employer-client and be
accompanied by a recruitment report bearing both joint employers' signatures and the contract or agreement
establishing the employers' relationship related to the workers sought.
(2) By signing the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, each employer independently attests
to the conditions of employment required of an employer participating in the H-2B program and assumes full
responsibility for the accuracy of the representations made in the application and for all of the responsibilities of an
employer in the H-2B program.
(e)(1) Either the job contractor or its employer-client may place the required job order and conduct recruitment
as described in §655.16 and §§655.42-46. Also, either one of the joint employers may assume responsibility for

interviewing applicants. However, both of the joint employers must sign the recruitment report that is submitted to
the NPC with the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, ETA Form 9142.
(2) The job order and all recruitment conducted by joint employers must satisfy the content requirements
identified in §655.18 and §655.41. Additionally, in order to fully apprise applicants of the job opportunity and avoid
potential confusion inherent in a job opportunity involving two employers, joint employer recruitment must clearly
identify both employers (the job contractor and its employer-client) by name and must clearly identify the worksite
location(s) where workers will perform labor or services.
(3)(i) Provided that all of the employer-clients' job opportunities are in the same occupation and area of
intended employment and have the same requirements and terms and conditions of employment, including dates of
employment, a job contractor may combine more than one of its joint employer employer-clients' job opportunities
in a single advertisement. Each advertisement must fully apprise potential workers of the job opportunity available
with each employer-client and otherwise satisfy the advertising content requirements required for all H-2B-related
advertisements, as identified in §655.41. Such a shared advertisement must clearly identify the job contractor by
name, the joint employment relationship, and the number of workers sought for each job opportunity, identified by
employer-client name and location (e.g. 5 openings with Employer-Client 1 (worksite location), 3 openings with
Employer-Client 2 (worksite location)).
(ii) In addition, the advertisement must contain the following statement: “Applicants may apply for any or all
of the jobs listed. When applying, please identify the job(s) (by company and work location) you are applying to for
the entire period of employment specified.” If an applicant fails to identify one or more specific work location(s),
that applicant is presumed to have applied to all work locations listed in the advertisement.
(f) If an application for joint employers is approved, the NPC will issue one certification and send it to the job
contractor. In order to ensure notice to both employers, a courtesy copy of the certification cover letter will be sent
to the employer-client.
(g) When submitting a certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification to USCIS, the job
contractor should submit the complete ETA Form 9142 containing the original signatures of both the job contractor
and employer-client.

ASSURANCES AND OBLIGATIONS
§655.20 Assurances and obligations of H-2B employers.
An employer employing H-2B workers and/or workers in corresponding employment under an Application for
Temporary Employment Certification has agreed as part of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification
that it will abide by the following conditions with respect to its H-2B workers and any workers in corresponding
employment:
(a) Rate of pay. (1) The offered wage in the job order equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing wage or
Federal minimum wage, State minimum wage, or local minimum wage. The employer must pay at least the offered
wage, free and clear, during the entire period of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification granted by
OFLC.
(2) The offered wage is not based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, including paying on a piecerate basis, unless the employer guarantees a wage earned every workweek that equals or exceeds the offered wage.

(3) If the employer requires one or more minimum productivity standards of workers as a condition of job
retention, the standards must be specified in the job order and the employer must demonstrate that they are normal
and usual for non-H-2B employers for the same occupation in the area of intended employment.
(4) An employer that pays on a piece-rate basis must demonstrate that the piece rate is no less than the normal
rate paid by non-H-2B employers to workers performing the same activity in the area of intended employment. The
average hourly piece rate earnings must result in an amount at least equal to the offered wage. If the worker is paid
on a piece rate basis and at the end of the workweek the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate
earnings during the workweek at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid
at the offered hourly wage, then the employer must supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's
earnings are at least as much as the worker would have earned during the workweek if the worker had instead been
paid at the offered hourly wage for each hour worked.
(b) Wages free and clear. The payment requirements for wages in this section will be satisfied by the timely
payment of such wages to the worker either in cash or negotiable instrument payable at par. The payment must be
made finally and unconditionally and “free and clear.” The principles applied in determining whether deductions are
reasonable and payments are received free and clear and the permissibility of deductions for payments to third
persons are explained in more detail in 29 CFR part 531.
(c) Deductions. The employer must make all deductions from the worker's paycheck required by law. The job
order must specify all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from the worker's pay; any
such deductions not disclosed in the job order are prohibited. The wage payment requirements of paragraph (b) of
this section are not met where unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the
worker below the minimum amounts required by the offered wage or where the worker fails to receive such amounts
free and clear because the worker “kicks back” directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the
employer's benefit the whole or part of the wages delivered to the worker. Authorized deductions are limited to:
Those required by law, such as taxes payable by workers that are required to be withheld by the employer and
amounts due workers which the employer is required by court order to pay to another; deductions for the reasonable
cost or fair value of board, lodging, and facilities furnished; and deductions of amounts which are authorized to be
paid to third persons for the worker's account and benefit through his or her voluntary assignment or order or which
are authorized by a collective bargaining agreement with bona fide representatives of workers which covers the
employer. Deductions for amounts paid to third persons for the worker's account and benefit which are not so
authorized or are contrary to law or from which the employer, agent or recruiter including any agents or employees
of these entities, or any affiliated person derives any payment, rebate, commission, profit, or benefit directly or
indirectly, may not be made if they reduce the actual wage paid to the worker below the offered wage indicated on
the Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(d) Job opportunity is full-time. The job opportunity is a full-time temporary position, consistent with §655.5,
and the employer must use a single workweek as its standard for computing wages due. An employee's workweek
must be a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours—seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It need not
coincide with the calendar week but may begin on any day and at any hour of the day.
(e) Job qualifications and requirements. Each job qualification and requirement must be listed in the job order
and must be bona fide and consistent with the normal and accepted qualifications and requirements imposed by nonH-2B employers in the same occupation and area of intended employment. The employer's job qualifications and
requirements imposed on U.S. workers must be no less favorable than the qualifications and requirements that the
employer is imposing or will impose on H-2B workers. A qualification means a characteristic that is necessary to the
individual's ability to perform the job in question. A requirement means a term or condition of employment which a
worker is required to accept in order to obtain the job opportunity. The CO may require the employer to submit
documentation to substantiate the appropriateness of any job qualification and/or requirement specified in the job
order.
(f) Three-fourths guarantee. (1) The employer must guarantee to offer the worker employment for a total
number of work hours equal to at least three-fourths of the workdays in each 12-week period (each 6-week period if
the period of employment covered by the job order is less than 120 days) beginning with the first workday after the

arrival of the worker at the place of employment or the advertised first date of need, whichever is later, and ending
on the expiration date specified in the job order or in its extensions, if any. See the exception in paragraph (y) of this
section.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph a workday means the number of hours in a workday as stated in the job
order. The employer must offer a total number of hours of work to ensure the provision of sufficient work to reach
the three-fourths guarantee in each 12-week period (each 6-week period if the period of employment covered by the
job order is less than 120 days) during the work period specified in the job order, or during any modified job order
period to which the worker and employer have mutually agreed and that has been approved by the CO.
(3) In the event the worker begins working later than the specified beginning date the guarantee period begins
with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment, and continues until the last day
during which the job order and all extensions thereof are in effect.
(4) The 12-week periods (6-week periods if the period of employment covered by the job order is less than
120 days) to which the guarantee applies are based upon the workweek used by the employer for pay purposes. The
first 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) also includes any partial workweek, if the first workday after
the worker's arrival at the place of employment is not the beginning of the employer's workweek, with the
guaranteed number of hours increased on a pro rata basis (thus, the first period may include up to 12 weeks and 6
days (or 6 weeks and 6 days, as appropriate)). The final 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) includes
any time remaining after the last full 12-week period (or 6-week period) ends, and thus may be as short as 1 day,
with the guaranteed number of hours decreased on a pro rata basis.
(5) Therefore, if, for example, a job order is for a 32-week period (a period greater than 120 days), during
which the normal workdays and work hours for the workweek are specified as 5 days a week, 7 hours per day, the
worker would have to be guaranteed employment for at least 315 hours (12 weeks × 35 hours/week = 420 hours ×
75 percent = 315) in the first 12-week period, at least 315 hours in the second 12-week period, and at least 210 hours
(8 weeks × 35 hours/week = 280 hours × 75 percent = 210) in the final partial period. If the job order is for a 16week period (less than 120 days), during which the normal workdays and work hours for the workweek are specified
as 5 days a week, 7 hours per day, the worker would have to be guaranteed employment for at least 157.5 hours (6
weeks × 35 hours/week = 210 hours × 75 percent = 157.5) in the first 6-week period, at least 157.5 hours in the
second 6-week period, and at least 105 hours (4 weeks × 35 hours/week = 140 hours × 75 percent = 105) in the final
partial period.
(6) If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer must use the worker's average hourly piece rate
earnings or the offered wage, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the guarantee.
(7) A worker may be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday. For purposes of
meeting the guarantee, however, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours
specified in the job order for a workday. The employer, however, may count all hours actually worked in calculating
whether the guarantee has been met. If during any 12-week period (6-week period if the period of employment
covered by the job order is less than 120 days) during the period of the job order the employer affords the U.S. or H2B worker less employment than that required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the employer must pay such
worker the amount the worker would have earned had the worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of
days. An employer has not met the work guarantee if the employer has merely offered work on three-fourths of the
workdays in an 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) if each workday did not consist of a full number
of hours of work time as specified in the job order.
(8) Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job order for
a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary work over 8 hours in a workday), may be
counted by the employer in calculating whether each 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) of
guaranteed employment has been met. An employer seeking to calculate whether the guaranteed number of hours
has been met must maintain the payroll records in accordance with this part.

(g) Impossibility of fulfillment. If, before the expiration date specified in the job order, the services of the
worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of
God, or similar unforeseeable man-made catastrophic event (such as an oil spill or controlled flooding) that is
wholly outside the employer's control that makes the fulfillment of the job order impossible, the employer may
terminate the job order with the approval of the CO. In the event of such termination of a job order, the employer
must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, for the time that has elapsed from
the start date listed in the job order or the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment,
whichever is later, to the time of its termination. The employer must make efforts to transfer the H-2B worker or
worker in corresponding employment to other comparable employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with
the INA, as applicable. If a transfer is not effected, the employer must return the worker, at the employer's expense,
to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening employment) came to work for the employer, or
transport the worker to the worker's next certified H-2B employer, whichever the worker prefers.
(h) Frequency of pay. The employer must state in the job order the frequency with which the worker will be
paid, which must be at least every 2 weeks or according to the prevailing practice in the area of intended
employment, whichever is more frequent. Employers must pay wages when due.
(i) Earnings statements. (1) The employer must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the
workers' earnings, including but not limited to: Records showing the nature, amount and location(s) of the work
performed; the number of hours of work offered each day by the employer (broken out by hours offered both in
accordance with and over and above the three-fourths guarantee in paragraph (f) of this section); the hours actually
worked each day by the worker; if the number of hours worked by the worker is less than the number of hours
offered, the reason(s) the worker did not work; the time the worker began and ended each workday; the rate of pay
(both piece rate and hourly, if applicable); the worker's earnings per pay period; the worker's home address; and the
amount of and reasons for any and all deductions taken from or additions made to the worker's wages.
(2) The employer must furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written statements the
following information:
(i) The worker's total earnings for each workweek in the pay period;
(ii) The worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(iii) For each workweek in the pay period the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in
accordance with the three-fourths guarantee as determined in paragraph (f) of this section, separate from any hours
offered over and above the guarantee);
(iv) For each workweek in the pay period the hours actually worked by the worker;
(v) An itemization of all deductions made from or additions made to the worker's wages;
(vi) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily;
(vii) The beginning and ending dates of the pay period; and
(viii) The employer's name, address and FEIN.
(j) Transportation and visa fees. (1)(i) Transportation to the place of employment. The employer must provide
or reimburse the worker for transportation and subsistence from the place from which the worker has come to work
for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad, to the place of employment if the worker completes 50 percent of
the period of employment covered by the job order (not counting any extensions). The employer may arrange and
pay for the transportation and subsistence directly, advance at a minimum the most economical and reasonable
common carrier cost of the transportation and subsistence to the worker before the worker's departure, or pay the

worker for the reasonable costs incurred by the worker. When it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2B employers in
the occupation in the area to do so or when the employer extends such benefits to similarly situated H-2B workers,
the employer must advance the required transportation and subsistence costs (or otherwise provide them) to workers
in corresponding employment who are traveling to the employer's worksite. The amount of the transportation
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier
transportation charges for the distances involved. The amount of the daily subsistence must be at least the amount
permitted in §655.173 of subpart B of this part. Where the employer will reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by
the worker, it must keep accurate and adequate records of: The cost of transportation and subsistence incurred by the
worker; the amount reimbursed; and the dates of reimbursement. Note that the FLSA applies independently of the
H-2B requirements and imposes obligations on employers regarding payment of wages.
(ii) Transportation from the place of employment. If the worker completes the period of employment covered
by the job order (not counting any extensions), or if the worker is dismissed from employment for any reason by the
employer before the end of the period, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H-2B employment, the
employer must provide or pay at the time of departure for the worker's cost of return transportation and daily
subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening
employment, departed to work for the employer. If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer that has
not agreed in the job order to provide or pay for the worker's transportation from the employer's worksite to such
subsequent employer's worksite, the employer must provide or pay for that transportation and subsistence. If the
worker has contracted with a subsequent employer that has agreed in the job order to provide or pay for the worker's
transportation from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must
provide or pay for such expenses.
(iii) Employer-provided transportation. All employer-provided transportation must comply with all applicable
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations and must provide, at a minimum, the same vehicle safety standards,
driver licensure requirements, and vehicle insurance as required under 49 CFR parts 390, 393, and 396.
(iv) Disclosure. All transportation and subsistence costs that the employer will pay must be disclosed in the
job order.
(2) The employer must pay or reimburse the worker in the first workweek for all visa, visa processing, border
crossing, and other related fees (including those mandated by the government) incurred by the H-2B worker, but not
for passport expenses or other charges primarily for the benefit of the worker.
(k) Employer-provided items. The employer must provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.
(l) Disclosure of job order. The employer must provide to an H-2B worker if outside of the U.S. no later than
the time at which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the
day work commences, a copy of the job order including any subsequent approved modifications. For an H-2B
worker changing employment from an H-2B employer to a subsequent H-2B employer, the copy must be provided
no later than the time an offer of employment is made by the subsequent H-2B employer. The disclosure of all
documents required by this paragraph must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or
reasonable.
(m) Notice of worker rights. The employer must post and maintain in a conspicuous location at the place of
employment a poster provided by the Department which sets out the rights and protections for H-2B workers and
workers in corresponding employment. The employer must post the poster in English. To the extent necessary, the
employer must request and post additional posters, as made available by the Department, in any language common
to a significant portion of the workers if they are not fluent in English.
(n) No unfair treatment. The employer has not and will not intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist,
discharge or in any manner discriminate against, and has not and will not cause any person to intimidate, threaten,
restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any manner discriminate against, any person who has:

(1) Filed a complaint under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 29 CFR part 503, or this subpart, or any other
Department regulation promulgated thereunder;
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 29 CFR part 503,
or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated thereunder;
(3) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 29 CFR part 503, or
this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated thereunder;
(4) Consulted with a workers' center, community organization, labor union, legal assistance program, or an
attorney on matters related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 29 CFR part 503, or this subpart or any other Department regulation
promulgated thereunder; or
(5) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself/herself or others any right or protection afforded by 8 U.S.C.
1184(c), 29 CFR part 503, or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated thereunder.
(o) Comply with the prohibitions against employees paying fees. The employer and its attorney, agents, or
employees have not sought or received payment of any kind from the worker for any activity related to obtaining H2B labor certification or employment, including payment of the employer's attorney or agent fees, application and
H-2B Petition fees, recruitment costs, or any fees attributed to obtaining the approved Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. For purposes of this paragraph, payment includes, but is not limited to, monetary
payments, wage concessions (including deductions from wages, salary, or benefits), kickbacks, bribes, tributes, in
kind payments, and free labor. All wages must be paid free and clear. This provision does not prohibit employers or
their agents from receiving reimbursement for costs that are the responsibility and primarily for the benefit of the
worker, such as government-required passport fees.
(p) Contracts with third parties to comply with prohibitions. The employer must contractually prohibit in
writing any agent or recruiter (or any agent or employee of such agent or recruiter) whom the employer engages,
either directly or indirectly, in international recruitment of H-2B workers to seek or receive payments or other
compensation from prospective workers. The contract must include the following statement: “Under this agreement,
[name of agent, recruiter] and any agent of or employee of [name of agent or recruiter] are prohibited from seeking
or receiving payments from any prospective employee of [employer name] at any time, including before or after the
worker obtains employment. Payments include but are not limited to, any direct or indirect fees paid by such
employees for recruitment, job placement, processing, maintenance, attorneys' fees, agent fees, application fees, or
petition fees.”
(q) Prohibition against preferential treatment of foreign workers. The employer's job offer must offer to U.S.
workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to
offer, or will provide to H-2B workers. Job offers may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or obligations
that will not be imposed on the employer's H-2B workers. This does not relieve the employer from providing to H2B workers at least the minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions which must be offered to U.S. workers
consistent with this section.
(r) Non-discriminatory hiring practices. The job opportunity is, and through the period set forth in paragraph
(t) of this section must continue to be, open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin,
age, sex, religion, disability, or citizenship. Rejections of any U.S. workers who applied or apply for the job must
only be for lawful, job-related reasons, and those not rejected on this basis have been or will be hired. In addition,
the employer has and will continue to retain records of all hired workers and rejected applicants as required by
§655.56.
(s) Recruitment requirements. The employer must conduct all required recruitment activities, including any
additional employer-conducted recruitment activities as directed by the CO, and as specified in §§655.40-655.46.

(t) Continuing requirement to hire U.S. workers. The employer has and will continue to cooperate with the
SWA by accepting referrals of all qualified U.S. workers who apply (or on whose behalf a job application is made)
for the job opportunity, and must provide employment to any qualified U.S. worker who applies to the employer for
the job opportunity, until 21 days before the date of need.
(u) No strike or lockout. There is no strike or lockout at any of the employer's worksites within the area of
intended employment for which the employer is requesting H-2B certification at the time the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification is filed.
(v) No recent or future layoffs. The employer has not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S.
worker in the occupation that is the subject of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in the area
of intended employment within the period beginning 120 calendar days before the date of need through the end of
the period of certification. A layoff for lawful, job-related reasons such as lack of work or the end of a season is
permissible if all H-2B workers are laid off before any U.S. worker in corresponding employment.
(w) Contact with former U.S. employees. The employer will contact (by mail or other effective means) its
former U.S. workers, including those who have been laid off within 120 calendar days before the date of need
(except those who were dismissed for cause or who abandoned the worksite), employed by the employer in the
occupation at the place of employment during the previous year, disclose the terms of the job order, and solicit their
return to the job.
(x) Area of intended employment and job opportunity. The employer must not place any H-2B workers
employed under the approved Application for Temporary Employment Certification outside the area of intended
employment or in a job opportunity not listed on the approved Application for Temporary Employment Certification
unless the employer has obtained a new approved Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(y) Abandonment/termination of employment. Upon the separation from employment of worker(s) employed
under the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or workers in corresponding employment, if such
separation occurs before the end date of the employment specified in the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, the employer must notify OFLC in writing of the separation from employment not later than 2 work
days after such separation is discovered by the employer. In addition, the employer must notify DHS in writing (or
any other method specified by the Department or DHS in the FEDERAL REGISTER or the Code of Federal
Regulations) of such separation of an H-2B worker. An abandonment or abscondment is deemed to begin after a
worker fails to report for work at the regularly scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of
the employer. If the separation is due to the voluntary abandonment of employment by the H-2B worker or worker
in corresponding employment, and the employer provides appropriate notification specified under this paragraph,
the employer will not be responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and subsistence
expenses of that worker under this section, and that worker is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee described in
paragraph (f) of this section. The employer's obligation to guarantee three-fourths of the work described in
paragraph (f) ends with the last full 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) preceding the worker's
voluntary abandonment or termination for cause.
(z) Compliance with applicable laws. During the period of employment specified on the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, the employer must comply with all applicable Federal, State and local
employment-related laws and regulations, including health and safety laws. In compliance with such laws, including
the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, 18 U.S.C. 1592(a), neither the
employer nor the employer's agents or attorneys may hold or confiscate workers' passports, visas, or other
immigration documents.
(aa) Disclosure of foreign worker recruitment. The employer, and its attorney or agent, as applicable, must
comply with §655.9 by providing a copy of all agreements with any agent or recruiter whom it engages or plans to
engage in the international recruitment of H-2B workers, and the identity and location of the persons or entities hired
by or working for the agent or recruiter and any of the agents or employees of those persons and entities, to recruit

foreign workers. Pursuant to §655.15(a), the agreements and information must be filed with the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification.

supporting evidence that must be maintained by the employer as proof that the additional recruitment requirements
were met. Documentation must be maintained as required in §655.56.

OFLC and the CO(s), by virtue of delegation from the Administrator, OFLC, have the authority to certify or deny
Applications for Temporary Employment Certification under the H-2B nonimmigrant classification. If the
Administrator, OFLC directs that certain types of temporary labor certification applications or a specific Application
for Temporary Employment Certification under the H-2B nonimmigrant classification be handled by the OFLC's
National Office, the Director of the NPC will refer such applications to the Administrator, OFLC.
(b) Determination. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the CO will make a determination either to
certify or deny the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The CO will certify the application only if
the employer has met all the requirements of this subpart, including the criteria for certification in §655.51, thus
demonstrating that there is an insufficient number of U.S. workers who are qualified and who will be available for
the job opportunity for which certification is sought and that the employment of the H-2B workers will not adversely
affect the benefits, wages, and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
[77 FR 10163, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.51 Criteria for certification.
(a) The criteria for certification include whether the employer has a valid H-2B Registration to participate in
the H-2B program and has complied with all of the requirements necessary to grant the labor certification.
(b) In making a determination whether there are insufficient U.S. workers to fill the employer's job
opportunity, the CO will count as available any U.S. worker referred by the SWA or any U.S. worker who applied
(or on whose behalf an application is made) directly to the employer, but who was rejected by the employer for other
than a lawful job-related reason.
(c) A certification will not be granted to an employer that has failed to comply with one or more sanctions or
remedies imposed by final agency actions under the H-2B program.
[77 FR 10164, Feb. 21, 2012]

Employment Certification and a Final Determination letter to the employer by means normally assuring next day
delivery, including electronic mail, and a copy, if applicable, to the employer's attorney or agent. If and when the

Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be permitted to be electronically filed, the employer must

means normally assuring next day delivery, including electronic mail, and a copy, if applicable, to the employer's
attorney or agent. The Final Determination letter will:
(a) State the reason(s) certification is denied, citing the relevant regulatory standards and/or special
procedures;
(b) Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review of the denial under §655.61; and
(c) State that if the employer does not request administrative review in accordance with §655.61, the denial is
final and the Department will not accept any appeal on that Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
[77 FR 10164, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.54 Partial certification.
The CO may issue a partial certification, reducing either the period of need or the number of H-2B workers or
both for certification, based upon information the CO receives during the course of processing the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification. The number of workers certified will be reduced by one for each referred
U.S. worker who is qualified and who will be available at the time and place needed to perform the services or labor
and who has not been rejected for lawful job-related reasons. If a partial labor certification is issued, the CO will
amend the Application for Temporary Employment Certification and then return it to the employer with a Final
Determination letter, with a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Final Determination letter
will:
(a) State the reason(s) why either the period of need and/or the number of H-2B workers requested has been
reduced, citing the relevant regulatory standards and/or special procedures;
(b) If applicable, address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation;
(c) Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review of the partial certification under
§655.61; and
(d) State that if the employer does not request administrative review in accordance with §655.61, the partial
certification is final and the Department will not accept any appeal on that Application for Temporary Employment
Certification.

[77 FR 10164, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.57 Request for determination based on nonavailability of U.S. workers.
(a) Standards for requests. If a temporary labor certification has been partially granted or denied, based on the
CO's determination that qualified U.S. workers are available, and, on or after 21 calendar days before the date of
need, some or all of those qualified U.S. workers are, in fact no longer available, the employer may request a new
temporary labor certification determination from the CO. Prior to making a new determination the CO will promptly
ascertain (which may be through the SWA or other sources of information on U.S. worker availability) whether
specific qualified replacement U.S. workers are available or can be reasonably expected to be present at the
employer's establishment with 72 hours from the date the employer's request was received. The CO will
expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a complete request (including the signed statement
included in paragraph (b) of this section) is received, make a determination on the request. An employer may appeal
a denial of such a determination in accordance with procedures contained in §655.61.
(b) Unavailability of U.S. workers. The employer's request for a new determination must be made directly to
the CO by electronic mail or other appropriate means and must be accompanied by a signed statement confirming
the employer's assertion. In addition, unless the employer has provided to the CO notification of abandonment or
termination of employment as required by §655.20(y), the employer's signed statement must include the name and

contact information of each U.S. worker who became unavailable and must supply the reason why the worker has
become unavailable.
(c) Notification of determination. If the CO determines that U.S. workers have become unavailable and cannot
identify sufficient available U.S. workers who are qualified or who are likely to become available, the CO will grant
the employer's request for a new determination. However, this does not preclude an employer from submitting
subsequent requests for new determinations, if warranted, based on subsequent facts concerning purported
nonavailability of U.S. workers or referred workers not being qualified because of lawful job-related reasons.

INTEGRITY MEASURES
§655.70 Audits.
The CO may conduct audits of adjudicated temporary labor certification applications.
(a) Discretion. The CO has the sole discretion to choose the applications selected for audit.
(b) Audit letter. Where an application is selected for audit, the CO will send an audit letter to the employer and
a copy, if appropriate, to the employer's attorney or agent. The audit letter will:
(1) Specify the documentation that must be submitted by the employer;

(2) Specify a date, no more than 30 calendar days from the date the audit letter is issued, by which the required
documentation must be sent to the CO; and
(3) Advise that failure to fully comply with the audit process may result:
(i) In the requirement that the employer undergo the assisted recruitment procedures in §655.71 in future
filings of H-2B temporary labor certification applications for a period of up to 2 years, or
(ii) In a revocation of the certification and/or debarment from the H-2B program and any other foreign labor
certification program administered by the Department.
(c) Supplemental information request. During the course of the audit examination, the CO may request
supplemental information and/or documentation from the employer in order to complete the audit. If circumstances
warrant, the CO can issue one or more requests for supplemental information.
(d) Potential referrals. In addition to measures in this subpart, the CO may decide to provide the audit findings
and underlying documentation to DHS, WHD, or other appropriate enforcement agencies. The CO may refer any
findings that an employer discouraged a qualified U.S. worker from applying, or failed to hire, discharged, or
otherwise discriminated against a qualified U.S. worker, to the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office
of Special Counsel for Unfair Immigration Related Employment Practices.
[77 FR 10166, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.71 CO-ordered assisted recruitment.
(a) Requirement of assisted recruitment. If, as a result of audit or otherwise, the CO determines that a violation
has occurred that does not warrant debarment, the CO may require the employer to engage in assisted recruitment
for a defined period of time for any future Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(b) Notification of assisted recruitment. The CO will notify the employer (and its attorney or agent, if
applicable) in writing of the assisted recruitment that will be required of the employer for a period of up to 2 years
from the date the notice is issued. The notification will state the reasons for the imposition of the additional
requirements, state that the employer's agreement to accept the conditions will constitute their inclusion as bona fide
conditions and terms of a temporary labor certification, and offer the employer an opportunity to request an
administrative review. If administrative review is requested, the procedures in §655.61 apply.
(c) Assisted recruitment. The assisted recruitment process will be in addition to any recruitment required of the
employer by §§655.41 through 655.47 and may consist of, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:
(1) Requiring the employer to submit a draft advertisement to the CO for review and approval at the time of
filing the Application for Temporary Employment Certification;
(2) Designating the sources where the employer must recruit for U.S. workers, including newspapers and other
publications, and directing the employer to place the advertisement(s) in such sources;
(3) Extending the length of the placement of the advertisement and/or job order;
(4) Requiring the employer to notify the CO and the SWA in writing when the advertisement(s) are placed;
(5) Requiring an employer to perform any additional assisted recruitment directed by the CO;

(6) Requiring the employer to provide proof of the publication of all advertisements as directed by the CO, in
addition to providing a copy of the job order;
(7) Requiring the employer to provide proof of all SWA referrals made in response to the job order;
(8) Requiring the employer to submit any proof of contact with all referrals and past U.S. workers; and/or
(9) Requiring the employer to provide any additional documentation verifying it conducted the assisted
recruitment as directed by the CO.
(d) Failure to comply. If an employer materially fails to comply with requirements ordered by the CO under
this section, the certification will be denied and the employer and/or its attorney or agent may be debarred under
§655.73.
[77 FR 10166, Feb. 21, 2012]

§655.72 Revocation.
(a) Basis for DOL revocation. The Administrator, OFLC may revoke a temporary labor certification approved
under this subpart, if the Administrator, OFLC finds:
(1) The issuance of the temporary labor certification was not justified due to fraud or willful misrepresentation
of a material fact in the application process, as defined in §655.73(d);
(2) The employer substantially failed to comply with any of the terms or conditions of the approved temporary
labor certification. A substantial failure is a willful failure to comply that constitutes a significant deviation from the
terms and conditions of the approved certification and is further defined in §655.73(d) and (e);
(3) The employer failed to cooperate with a DOL investigation or with a DOL official performing an
investigation, inspection, audit (under §655.73), or law enforcement function under 29 CFR part 503 or this subpart;
or
(4) The employer failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by WHD, or with one or
more decisions or orders of the Secretary with the respect to the H-2B program.
(b) DOL procedures for revocation. (1) Notice of Revocation. If the Administrator, OFLC makes a
determination to revoke an employer's temporary labor certification, the Administrator, OFLC will send to the
employer (and its attorney or agent, if applicable) a Notice of Revocation. The notice will contain a detailed
statement of the grounds for the revocation and inform the employer of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or to
appeal. If the employer does not file rebuttal evidence or an appeal within 10 business days from the date the Notice
of Revocation is issued, the notice is the final agency action and will take effect immediately at the end of the 10day period.
(2) Rebuttal. If the employer timely submits rebuttal evidence, the Administrator, OFLC will inform the
employer of the final determination on the revocation within 10 business days of receiving the rebuttal evidence. If
the Administrator, OFLC determines that the certification should be revoked, the Administrator, OFLC will inform
the employer of its right to appeal according to the procedures of §655.61. If the employer does not appeal the final
determination, it will become the final agency action.
(3) Appeal. An employer may appeal a Notice of Revocation, or a final determination of the Administrator,
OFLC after the review of rebuttal evidence, according to the appeal procedures of §655.61. The ALJ's decision is
the final agency action.

(4) Stay. The timely filing of rebuttal evidence or an administrative appeal will stay the revocation pending the
outcome of those proceedings.
(5) Decision. If the temporary labor certification is revoked, the Administrator, OFLC will send a copy of the
final agency action to DHS and the Department of State.
(c) Employer's obligations in the event of revocation. If an employer's temporary labor certification is revoked,
the employer is responsible for:
(1) Reimbursement of actual inbound transportation and other expenses;
(2) The workers' outbound transportation expenses;
(3) Payment to the workers of the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee; and
(4) Any other wages, benefits, and working conditions due or owing to the workers under this subpart.

§655.73 Debarment.
(a) Debarment of an employer. The Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications under this
subpart to an employer or any successor in interest to that employer, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph
(c) of this section, if the Administrator, OFLC finds that the employer committed the following violations:
(1) Willful misrepresentation of a material fact in its H-2B Registration, Application for Temporary
Employment Certification, or H-2B Petition;
(2) Substantial failure to meet any of the terms and conditions of its H-2B Registration, Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, or H-2B Petition. A substantial failure is a willful failure to comply that
constitutes a significant deviation from the terms and conditions of such documents; or
(3) Willful misrepresentation of a material fact to the DOS during the visa application process.
(b) Debarment of an agent or attorney. If the Administrator, OFLC finds, under this section, that an attorney
or agent committed a violation as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section or participated in an
employer's violation, the Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications to an employer represented
by such agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Period of debarment. Debarment under this subpart may not be for less than 1 year or more than 5 years
from the date of the final agency decision.
(d) Determining whether a violation is willful. A willful misrepresentation of a material fact or a willful failure
to meet the required terms and conditions occurs when the employer, attorney, or agent knows a statement is false or
that the conduct is in violation, or shows reckless disregard for the truthfulness of its representation or for whether
its conduct satisfies the required conditions.
(e) Determining whether a violation is significant. In determining whether a violation is a significant deviation
from the terms and conditions of the H-2B Registration, Application for Temporary Employment Certification, or H2B Petition, the factors that the Administrator, OFLC may consider include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation(s) under the H-2B program;

(2) The number of H-2B workers, workers in corresponding employment, or improperly rejected U.S.
applicants who were and/or are affected by the violation(s);
(3) The gravity of the violation(s);
(4) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation(s), or the potential financial
loss or potential injury to the worker(s); and
(5) Whether U.S. workers have been harmed by the violation.
(f) Violations. Where the standards set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) in this section are met, debarrable
violations would include but would not be limited to one or more acts of commission or omission which involve:
(1) Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits or working conditions to the employer's H-2B
workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;
(2) Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied
for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;
(3) Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;
(4) Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;
(5) Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the Administrator, WHD for
violation(s) of obligations under the job order or other H-2B obligations, or with one or more decisions or orders of
the Secretary or a court under this subpart or 29 CFR part 503;
(6) Failure to comply with the Notice of Deficiency process under this subpart;
(7) Failure to comply with the assisted recruitment process under this subpart;

(9) Employing an H-2B worker outside the area of intended employment, in an activity/activities not listed in
the job order, or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension
thereof;
(10) A violation of the requirements of §655.20(o) or (p);
(11) A violation of any of the provisions listed in §655.20(r);
(12) Any other act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program
requirements cannot reasonably be expected;
(13) Fraud involving the H-2B Registration, Application for Temporary Employment Certification or the H-2B
Petition; or
(14) A material misrepresentation of fact during the registration or application process.
(g) Debarment procedure. (1) Notice of Debarment. If the Administrator, OFLC makes a determination to
debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the Administrator, OFLC will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The
Notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the

duration of the debarment and inform the party subject to the notice of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or to
request a debarment hearing. If the party does not file rebuttal evidence or request a hearing within 30 calendar days
of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the notice is the final agency action and the debarment will take effect at the
end of the 30-day period. The timely filing of an rebuttal evidence or a request for a hearing stays the debarment
pending the outcome of the appeal as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)-(6) of this section.
(2) Rebuttal. The party who received the Notice of Debarment may choose to submit evidence to rebut the
grounds stated in the notice within 30 calendar days of the date the notice is issued. If rebuttal evidence is timely
filed, the Administrator, OFLC will issue a final determination on the debarment within 30 calendar days of
receiving the rebuttal evidence. If the Administrator, OFLC determines that the party should be debarred, the
Administrator, OFLC will inform the party of its right to request a debarment hearing according to the procedures in
this section. The party must request a hearing within 30 calendar days after the date of the Administrator, OFLC's
final determination, or the Administrator OFLC's determination will be the final agency order and the debarment
will take effect at the end of the 30-day period.
(3) Hearing. The recipient of a Notice of Debarment seeking to challenge the debarment must request a
debarment hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of a Notice of Debarment or the date of a final determination
of the Administrator, OFLC after review of rebuttal evidence submitted under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. To
obtain a debarment hearing, the recipient must, within 30 days of the date of the Notice or the final determination,
file a written request with the Chief ALJ, United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street, NW., Suite 400-N,
Washington, DC 20001-8002, and simultaneously serve a copy on the Administrator, OFLC. The debarment will
take effect 30 calendar days from the date the Notice of Debarment or final determination is issued, unless a request
for review is timely filed. Within 10 business days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the Administrator, OFLC
will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief ALJ by means normally assuring next day delivery. The
Chief ALJ will immediately assign an ALJ to conduct the hearing. The procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to such
hearings, except that the request for a hearing will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is
required.
(4) Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the Administrator, OFLC's
determination. The ALJ will prepare the decision within 60 calendar days after completion of the hearing and
closing of the record. The ALJ's decision will be provided to the parties to the debarment hearing by means normally
assuring next day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final agency action, unless either party, within 30 calendar
days of the ALJ's decision, seeks review of the decision with the Administrative Review Board (ARB).
(5) Review by the ARB. (i) Any party wishing review of the decision of an ALJ must, within 30 calendar days
of the decision of the ALJ, petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition must be served on all
parties and on the ALJ. The ARB will decide whether to accept the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt. If the
ARB declines to accept the petition, or if the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition within 30 calendar
days after the receipt of a timely filing of the petition, the decision of the ALJ is the final agency action. If a petition
for review is accepted, the decision of the ALJ will be stayed unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the
decision. The ARB must serve notice of its decision to accept or not to accept the petition upon the ALJ and upon all
parties to the proceeding.
(ii) Upon receipt of the ARB's notice to accept the petition, the Office of Administrative Law Judges will
promptly forward a copy of the complete hearing record to the ARB.
(iii) Where the ARB has determined to review the decision and order, the ARB will notify each party of the
issue(s) raised, the form in which submissions must be made (e.g., briefs or oral argument), and the time within
which the presentation must be submitted.
(6) ARB Decision. The ARB's final decision must be issued within 90 calendar days from the notice granting
the petition and served upon all parties and the ALJ.

(h) Concurrent debarment jurisdiction. OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction to debar under this
section or under 29 CFR 503.24. When considering debarment, OFLC and the WHD will coordinate their activities.
A specific violation for which debarment is imposed will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. Copies of final
debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS and DOS promptly.
(i) Debarment from other foreign labor programs. Upon debarment under this subpart or 29 CFR 503.24, the
debarred party will be disqualified from filing any labor certification applications or labor condition applications
with the Department by, or on behalf of, the debarred party for the same period of time set forth in the final
debarment decision.

Subpart B—Labor Certification Process for Temporary Agricultural
Employment in the United States (H-2A Workers)
SOURCE: 75 FR 6959, Feb. 12, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

§655.100 Scope and purpose of subpart B.
This subpart sets out the procedures established by the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor
(the Secretary) under the authority given in 8 U.S.C. 1188 to acquire information sufficient to make factual
determinations of:
(a) Whether there are sufficient able, willing, and qualified United States (U.S.) workers available to perform
the temporary and seasonal agricultural employment for which an employer desires to import nonimmigrant foreign
workers (H-2A workers); and
(b) Whether the employment of H-2A workers will adversely affect the wages and working conditions of
workers in the U.S. similarly employed.
§655.101 Authority of the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) Administrator.
The Secretary has delegated her authority to make determinations under 8 U.S.C. 1188 to the Assistant
Secretary for the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), who in turn has delegated that authority to the
Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The determinations are made by the OFLC Administrator who, in
turn, may delegate this responsibility to designated staff members; e.g., a Certifying Officer (CO).
§655.102 Special procedures.
To provide for a limited degree of flexibility in carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities under the
Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), while not deviating from statutory requirements, the OFLC Administrator
has the authority to establish, continue, revise, or revoke special procedures for processing certain H-2A
applications. Employers must demonstrate upon written application to the OFLC Administrator that special
procedures are necessary. These include special procedures currently in effect for the handling of applications for
sheepherders in the Western States (and adaptation of such procedures to occupations in the range production of
other livestock), and for custom combine harvesting crews. Similarly, for work in occupations characterized by
other than a reasonably regular workday or workweek, such as the range production of sheep or other livestock, the
OFLC Administrator has the authority to establish monthly, weekly, or semi-monthly adverse effect wage rates
(AEWR) for those occupations for a statewide or other geographical area. Prior to making determinations under this
section, the OFLC Administrator may consult with affected employer and worker representatives. Special
Procedures in place on the effective date of this regulation will remain in force until modified by the Administrator.
§655.103 Overview of this subpart and definition of terms.
(a) Overview. In order to bring nonimmigrant workers to the U.S. to perform agricultural work, an employer
must first demonstrate to the Secretary that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, and qualified to
perform the work in the area of intended employment at the time needed and that the employment of foreign
workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. This rule
describes a process by which the Department of Labor (Department or DOL) makes such a determination and
certifies its determination to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
(b) Definitions. For the purposes of this subpart:
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). A person within the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges
appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105.
Adverse effect wage rate (AEWR). The annual weighted average hourly wage for field and livestock workers
(combined) in the States or regions as published annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) based on
its quarterly wage survey.

Agent. A legal entity or person, such as an association of agricultural employers, or an attorney for an
association, that:
(1) Is authorized to act on behalf of the employer for temporary agricultural labor certification purposes;
(2) Is not itself an employer, or a joint employer, as defined in this subpart with respect to a specific
application; and
(3) Is not under suspension, debarment, expulsion, or disbarment from practice before any court, the
Department, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or DHS under 8 CFR 292.3 or 1003.101.
Agricultural association. Any nonprofit or cooperative association of farmers, growers, or ranchers (including
but not limited to processing establishments, canneries, gins, packing sheds, nurseries, or other similar fixed-site
agricultural employers), incorporated or qualified under applicable State law, that recruits, solicits, hires, employs,
furnishes, houses, or transports any worker that is subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188. An agricultural association may act as
the agent of an employer, or may act as the sole or joint employer of any worker subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188.
Area of intended employment. The geographic area within normal commuting distance of the place of the job
opportunity for which the certification is sought. There is no rigid measure of distance that constitutes a normal
commuting distance or normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual circumstances among
different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the worksite, or quality of the regional
transportation network). If the place of intended employment is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA),
including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the
place of intended employment. The borders of MSAs are not controlling in the identification of the normal
commuting area; a location outside of an MSA may be within normal commuting distance of a location that is inside
(e.g., near the border of) the MSA.
Attorney. Any person who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State,
possession, territory, or commonwealth of the U.S., or the District of Columbia. Such a person is also permitted to
act as an agent under this subpart. No attorney who is under suspension, debarment, expulsion, or disbarment from
practice before any court, the Department, the Executive Office for Immigration Review under 8 CFR 1003.101, or
DHS under 8 CFR 292.3 may represent an employer under this subpart.
Certifying Officer (CO). The person who makes determination on an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification filed under the H-2A program. The OFLC Administrator is the national CO. Other COs may be
designated by the OFLC Administrator to also make the determinations required under this subpart.
Corresponding employment. The employment of workers who are not H-2A workers by an employer who has
an approved H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification in any work included in the job order, or in
any agricultural work performed by the H-2A workers. To qualify as corresponding employment the work must be
performed during the validity period of the job order, including any approved extension thereof.
Date of need. The first date the employer requires the services of H-2A workers as indicated in the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification.
Employee. A person who is engaged to perform work for an employer, as defined under the general common
law of agency. Some of the factors relevant to the determination of employee status include: The hiring party's right
to control the manner and means by which the work is accomplished; the skill required to perform the work; the
source of the instrumentalities and tools for accomplishing the work; the location of the work; the hiring party's
discretion over when and how long to work; and whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party.
Other applicable factors may be considered and no one factor is dispositive.

Employer. A person (including any individual, partnership, association, corporation, cooperative, firm, joint
stock company, trust, or other organization with legal rights and duties) that:
(1) Has a place of business (physical location) in the U.S. and a means by which it may be contacted for
employment;
(2) Has an employer relationship (such as the ability to hire, pay, fire, supervise or otherwise control the work
of employee) with respect to an H-2A worker or a worker in corresponding employment; and
(3) Possesses, for purposes of filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification, a valid Federal
Employer Identification Number (FEIN).
Federal holiday. Legal public holiday as defined at 5 U.S.C. 6103.
Fixed-site employer. Any person engaged in agriculture who meets the definition of an employer, as those
terms are defined in this subpart, who owns or operates a farm, ranch, processing establishment, cannery, gin,
packing shed, nursery, or other similar fixed-site location where agricultural activities are performed and who
recruits, solicits, hires, employs, houses, or transports any worker subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this
subpart as incident to or in conjunction with the owner's or operator's own agricultural operation.
H-2A Labor Contractor (H-2ALC). Any person who meets the definition of employer under this subpart and is
not a fixed-site employer, an agricultural association, or an employee of a fixed-site employer or agricultural
association, as those terms are used in this part, who recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes, houses, or transports
any worker subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this subpart.
H-2A worker. Any temporary foreign worker who is lawfully present in the U.S. and authorized by DHS to
perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a),
as amended.

Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order (Form ETA-790), as submitted to the SWA.
Joint employment. Where two or more employers each have sufficient definitional indicia of being an
employer to be considered the employer of a worker, those employers will be considered to jointly employ that
worker. Each employer in a joint employment relationship to a worker is considered a joint employer of that worker.
Master application. An Application for Temporary Employment Certification filed by an association of
agricultural producers as a joint employer with its employer-members. A master application must cover the same
occupations or comparable agricultural employment; the same start date of need for all employer-members listed on
the Application for Temporary Employment Certification; and may cover multiple areas of intended employment
within a single State but no more than two contiguous States.
National Processing Center (NPC). The office within OFLC in which the COs operate and which are charged
with the adjudication of Applications for Temporary Employment Certification.

Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). OFLC means the organizational component of the ETA that
provides national leadership and policy guidance and develops regulations and procedures to carry out the
responsibilities of the Secretary under the INA concerning the admission of foreign workers to the U.S. to perform
work described in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a).
OFLC Administrator. The primary official of the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), or the OFLC
Administrator's designee.

(2) This 50 percent or more of employers also employs 50 percent or more of U.S. workers in the occupation
and area (including H-2A and non-H-2A employers) for purposes of determinations concerning the provision of
family housing, and frequency of wage payments, but non-H-2A employers only for determinations concerning the
provision of advance transportation and the utilization of labor contractors.
Prevailing wage. Wage established pursuant to 20 CFR 653.501(d)(4).
State Workforce Agency (SWA). State government agency that receives funds pursuant to the Wagner-Peyser
Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.) to administer the State's public labor exchange activities.
Strike. A concerted stoppage of work by employees as a result of a labor dispute, or any concerted slowdown
or other concerted interruption of operation (including stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collective
bargaining agreement).
Successor in interest. (1) Where an employer has violated 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or these
regulations, and has ceased doing business or cannot be located for purposes of enforcement, a successor in interest
to that employer may be held liable for the duties and obligations of the violating employer in certain circumstances.
The following factors, as used under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment
Assistance Act, may be considered in determining whether an employer is a successor in interest; no one factor is
dispositive, but all of the circumstances will be considered as a whole:
(i) Substantial continuity of the same business operations;
(ii) Use of the same facilities;
(iii) Continuity of the work force;
(iv) Similarity of jobs and working conditions;
(v) Similarity of supervisory personnel;
(vi) Whether the former management or owner retains a direct or indirect interest in the new enterprise;

(vii) Similarity in machinery, equipment, and production methods;
(viii) Similarity of products and services; and
(ix) The ability of the predecessor to provide relief.
(2) For purposes of debarment only, the primary consideration will be the personal involvement of the firm's
ownership, management, supervisors, and others associated with the firm in the violation(s) at issue.
Temporary agricultural labor certification. Certification made by the OFLC Administrator with respect to an
employer seeking to file with DHS a visa petition to employ one or more foreign nationals as an H-2A worker,

conditions, and other benefits, including those required by 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this subpart. The
contract between the employer and the worker may be in the form of a separate written document. In the absence of
a separate written work contract incorporating the required terms and conditions of employment, agreed to by both
the employer and the worker, the work contract at a minimum will be the terms of the job order and any obligations
required under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 28 CFR part 501, or this subpart.
(c) Definition of agricultural labor or services. For the purposes of this subpart, agricultural labor or services,
pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), is defined as: agricultural labor as defined and applied in sec. 3121(g) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 3121(g); agriculture as defined and applied in sec. 3(f) of the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) at 29 U.S.C. 203(f); the pressing of apples for cider on a farm; or logging
employment. An occupation included in either statutory definition is agricultural labor or services, notwithstanding
the exclusion of that occupation from the other statutory definition. For informational purposes, the statutory
provisions are listed below.
(1)(i) Agricultural labor for the purpose of paragraph (c) of this section means all service performed:
(A) On a farm, in the employ of any person, in connection with cultivating the soil, or in connection with
raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for,
training, and management of livestock, bees, poultry, and fur-bearing animals and wildlife;
(B) In the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a farm, in connection with the operation,

unmanufactured state, any agricultural or horticultural commodity; but only if such operator produced more than
one-half of the commodity with respect to which such service is performed;
(E) In the employ of a group of operators of farms (other than a cooperative organization) in the performance
of service described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section but only if such operators produced all of the commodity
with respect to which such service is performed. For purposes of this paragraph, any unincorporated group of
operators shall be deemed a cooperative organization if the number of operators comprising such group is more than
20 at any time during the calendar year in which such service is performed;
(F) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (c)(1)(v) of this section shall not be deemed to be applicable
with respect to service performed in connection with commercial canning or commercial freezing or in connection
with any agricultural or horticultural commodity after its delivery to a terminal market for distribution for
consumption; or
(G) On a farm operated for profit if such service is not in the course of the employer's trade or business or is
domestic service in a private home of the employer.
(ii) As used in this section, the term farm includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, fur-bearing animal, and truck
farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, ranges, greenhouses or other similar structures used primarily for the raising
of agricultural or horticultural commodities, and orchards.
(2) Agriculture. For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, agriculture means farming in all its branches and
among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and
harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities (including commodities defined as agricultural
commodities in 1141j(g) of title 12, the raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry, and any practices
(including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in
conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to
carriers for transportation to market. See sec. 29 U.S.C. 203(f), as amended (sec. 3(f) of the FLSA, as codified).
Under 12 U.S.C. 1141j(g) agricultural commodities include, in addition to other agricultural commodities, crude
gum (oleoresin) from a living tree, and the following products as processed by the original producer of the crude
gum (oleoresin) from which derived: gum spirits of turpentine and gum rosin. In addition as defined in 7 U.S.C. 92,
gum spirits of turpentine means spirits of turpentine made from gum (oleoresin) from a living tree and gum rosin
means rosin remaining after the distillation of gum spirits of turpentine.
(3) Apple pressing for cider. The pressing of apples for cider on a farm, as the term farm is defined and
applied in sec. 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 3121(g) or as applied in sec. 3(f) of the FLSA at
29 U.S.C. 203(f), pursuant to 29 CFR part 780.
(4) Logging employment. Operations associated with felling and moving trees and logs from the stump to the
point of delivery, such as, but not limited to, marking danger trees and trees/logs to be cut to length, felling, limbing,
bucking, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, and transporting machines, equipment and
personnel to, from and between logging sites.

(d) Definition of a temporary or seasonal nature. For the purposes of this subpart, employment is of a seasonal
nature where it is tied to a certain time of year by an event or pattern, such as a short annual growing cycle or a
specific aspect of a longer cycle, and requires labor levels far above those necessary for ongoing operations.
Employment is of a temporary nature where the employer's need to fill the position with a temporary worker will,
except in extraordinary circumstances, last no longer than 1 year.

PREFILING PROCEDURES
§655.120 Offered wage rate.
(a) To comply with its obligation under §655.122(l), an employer must offer, advertise in its recruitment, and
pay a wage that is the highest of the AEWR, the prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the agreed-upon collective
bargaining wage, or the Federal or State minimum wage, except where a special procedure is approved for an
occupation or specific class of agricultural employment.
(b) If the prevailing hourly wage rate or piece rate is adjusted during a work contract, and is higher than the
highest of the AEWR, the prevailing wage, the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage, or the Federal or State
minimum wage, in effect at the time the work is performed, the employer must pay that higher prevailing wage or
piece rate, upon notice to the employer by the Department.
(c) The OFLC Administrator will publish, at least once in each calendar year, on a date to be determined by
the OFLC Administrator, the AEWRs for each State as a notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
§655.121 Job orders.
(a) Area of intended employment. (1) Prior to filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
the employer must submit a job order, Form ETA-790, to the SWA serving the area of intended employment for
intrastate clearance, identifying it as a job order to be placed in connection with a future Application for Temporary
Employment Certification for H-2A workers. The employer must submit this job order no more than 75 calendar
days and no fewer than 60 calendar days before the date of need. If the job opportunity is located in more than one
State within the same area of intended employment, the employer may submit a job order to any one of the SWAs
having jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites.
(2) Where the job order is being placed in connection with a future master application to be filed by an
association of agricultural employers as a joint employer, the association may submit a single job order to be placed
in the name of the association on behalf of all employers that will be duly named on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification.
(3) The job order submitted to the SWA must satisfy the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20
CFR part 653, subpart F and the requirements set forth in §655.122.
(b) SWA review. (1) The SWA will review the contents of the job order for compliance with the requirements
specified in 20 CFR part 653, subpart F and this subpart, and will work with the employer to address any noted
deficiencies. The SWA must notify the employer in writing of any deficiencies in its job order no later than 7
calendar days after it has been submitted. The SWA notification will direct the employer to respond to the noted
deficiencies. The employer must respond to the deficiencies noted by the SWA within 5 calendar days after receipt
of the SWA notification. The SWA must respond to the employer's response within 3 calendar days.
(2) If, after providing responses to the deficiencies noted by the SWA, the employer is not able to resolve the
deficiencies with the SWA, the employer may file an Application for Temporary Employment Certification pursuant
to the emergency filing procedures contained in §655.134, with a statement describing the nature of the dispute and
demonstrating compliance with its requirements under this section. In the event the SWA does not respond within
the stated timelines, the employer may use the emergency filing procedures noted above. If upon review of the

Application for Temporary Employment Certification and the job order and all other relevant information, the CO
concludes that the job order is acceptable, the CO will direct the SWA to place the job order into intrastate and
interstate clearance and otherwise process the Application in accordance with the procedures contained in
§655.134(c). If the CO determines the job order is not acceptable, the CO will issue a Notice of Deficiency to the
employer under §655.143 of this subpart directing the employer to modify the job order pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this section The Notice of Deficiency will offer the employer the right to appeal.
(c) Intrastate clearance. Upon its clearance of the job order, the SWA must promptly place the job order in
intrastate clearance and commence recruitment of U.S. workers. Where the employer's job order references an area
of intended employment which falls within the jurisdiction of more than one SWA, the originating SWA will also
forward a copy of the approved job order to the other SWAs serving the area of intended employment.
(d) Duration of job order posting. The SWA must keep the job order on its active file until the end of the
recruitment period, as set forth in §655.135(d), and must refer each U.S. worker who applies (or on whose behalf an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification is made) for the job opportunity.
(e) Modifications to the job order. (1) Prior to the issuance of the final determination, the CO may require
modifications to the job order when the CO determines that the offer of employment does not contain all the
minimum benefits, wages, and working condition provisions. Such modifications must be made or certification will
be denied pursuant to §655.164 of this subpart.
(2) The employer may request a modification of the job order, Form ETA-790, prior to the submission of an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification. However, the employer may not reject referrals against the
job order based upon a failure on the part of the applicant to meet the amended criteria, if such referral was made
prior to the amendment of the job order. The employer may not amend the job order on or after the date of filing an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(3) The employer must provide all workers recruited in connection with the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification with a copy of the modified job order or work contract which reflects the amended terms
and conditions, on the first day of employment, in accordance with §655.122(q), or as soon as practicable,
whichever comes first.
§655.122 Contents of job offers.
(a) Prohibition against preferential treatment of aliens. The employer's job offer must offer to U.S. workers
no less than the same benefits, wages, and working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will
provide to H-2A workers. Job offers may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or obligations that will not be
imposed on the employer's H-2A workers. This does not relieve the employer from providing to H-2A workers at
least the same level of minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions which must be offered to U.S. workers
consistent with this section.
(b) Job qualifications and requirements. Each job qualification and requirement listed in the job offer must be
bona fide and consistent with the normal and accepted qualifications required by employers that do not use H-2A
workers in the same or comparable occupations and crops. Either the CO or the SWA may require the employer to
submit documentation to substantiate the appropriateness of any job qualification specified in the job offer.
(c) Minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. Every job order accompanying an Application for
Temporary Employment Certification must include each of the minimum benefit, wage, and working condition
provisions listed in paragraphs (d) through (q) of this section.
(d) Housing. (1) Obligation to provide housing. The employer must provide housing at no cost to the H-2A
workers and those workers in corresponding employment who are not reasonably able to return to their residence
within the same day. Housing must be provided through one of the following means:

(i) Employer-provided housing. Employer-provided housing must meet the full set of DOL Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142, or the full set of standards at
§§654.404 through 654.417 of this chapter, whichever are applicable under §654.401 of this chapter. Requests by
employers whose housing does not meet the applicable standards for conditional access to the interstate clearance
system, will be processed under the procedures set forth at §654.403 of this chapter; or
(ii) Rental and/or public accommodations. Rental or public accommodations or other substantially similar
class of habitation must meet local standards for such housing. In the absence of applicable local standards, State
standards will apply. In the absence of applicable local or State standards, DOL OSHA standards at 29 CFR
1910.142 will apply. Any charges for rental housing must be paid directly by the employer to the owner or operator
of the housing. The employer must document to the satisfaction of the CO that the housing complies with the local,
State, or Federal housing standards.
(2) Standards for range housing. Housing for workers principally engaged in the range production of livestock
must meet standards of DOL OSHA for such housing. In the absence of such standards, range housing for
sheepherders and other workers engaged in the range production of livestock must meet guidelines issued by OFLC.
(3) Deposit charges. Charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other similar incidentals related to housing
must not be levied upon workers. However, employers may require workers to reimburse them for damage caused to
housing by the individual worker(s) found to have been responsible for damage which is not the result of normal
wear and tear related to habitation.
(4) Charges for public housing. If public housing provided for migrant agricultural workers under the auspices
of a local, county, or State government is secured by the employer, the employer must pay any charges normally
required for use of the public housing units directly to the housing's management.
(5) Family housing. When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation
to provide family housing, it must be provided to workers with families who request it.
(6) Certified housing that becomes unavailable. If after a request to certify housing, such housing becomes
unavailable for reasons outside the employer's control, the employer may substitute other rental or public
accommodation housing that is in compliance with the local, State, or Federal housing standards applicable under
this section. The employer must promptly notify the SWA in writing of the change in accommodations and the
reason(s) for such change and provide the SWA evidence of compliance with the applicable local, State or Federal
safety and health standards, in accordance with the requirements of this section. If, upon inspection, the SWA
determines the substituted housing does not meet the applicable housing standards, the SWA must promptly provide
written notification to the employer to cure the deficiencies with a copy to the CO. An employer's failure to provide
housing that complies with the applicable standards will result in either a denial of a pending Application for
Temporary Employment Certification or revocation of the temporary labor certification granted under this subpart.
(e) Workers' compensation. (1) The employer must provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in
compliance with State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.
If the type of employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's
workers' compensation law, the employer must provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and
disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at least equal to those
provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment.
(2) Prior to issuance of the temporary labor certification, the employer must provide the CO with proof of
workers' compensation insurance coverage meeting the requirements of this paragraph, including the name of the
insurance carrier, the insurance policy number, and proof of insurance for the dates of need, or, if appropriate, proof
of State law coverage.
(f) Employer-provided items. The employer must provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all
tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.

(g) Meals. The employer either must provide each worker with three meals a day or must furnish free and
convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.
Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer must state the charge, if any, to the worker for such meals. The
amount of meal charges is governed by §655.173.
(h) Transportation; daily subsistence—(1) Transportation to place of employment. If the employer has not
previously advanced such transportation and subsistence costs to the worker or otherwise provided such
transportation or subsistence directly to the worker by other means and if the worker completes 50 percent of the
work contract period, the employer must pay the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for
transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker has come to work for the employer,
whether in the U.S. or abroad to the place of employment. When it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2A
agricultural employers in the occupation in the area to do so, or when the employer extends such benefits to
similarly situated H-2A workers, the employer must advance the required transportation and subsistence costs (or
otherwise provide them) to workers in corresponding employment who are traveling to the employer's worksite. The
amount of the transportation payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and
reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. The amount of the daily subsistence
payment must be at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three
meals a day during employment (if applicable), but in no event less than the amount permitted under §655.173(a).
Note that the FLSA applies independently of the H-2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers
regarding payment of wages.
(2) Transportation from place of employment. If the worker completes the work contract period, or if the
employee is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H-2A employment, the
employer must provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to
the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer. If the
worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for
the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent
employer's worksite, the employer must provide or pay for such expenses. If the worker has contracted with a
subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and
daily subsistence expenses from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the subsequent
employer must provide or pay for such expenses. The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for
return transportation and subsistence if an H-2A worker is displaced as a result of the employer's compliance with
the 50 percent rule as described in §655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the referrals made after the employer's
date of need.
(3) Transportation between living quarters and worksite. The employer must provide transportation between
housing provided or secured by the employer and the employer's worksite at no cost to the worker.
(4) Employer-provided transportation. All employer-provided transportation must comply with all applicable
Federal, State or local laws and regulations, and must provide, at a minimum, the same transportation safety
standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as required under 29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 29
CFR 500.120 to 500.128. If workers' compensation is used to cover transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the
employer must either ensure that the workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle insurance exists to
provide coverage for travel not covered by workers' compensation and they must have property damage insurance.
(i) Three-fourths guarantee—(1) Offer to worker. The employer must guarantee to offer the worker
employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least three-fourths of the workdays of the total period
beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or the advertised
contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or
in its extensions, if any.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph a workday means the number of hours in a workday as stated in the job
order and excludes the worker's Sabbath and Federal holidays. The employer must offer a total number of hours to
ensure the provision of sufficient work to reach the three-fourths guarantee. The work hours must be offered during

the work period specified in the work contract, or during any modified work contract period to which the worker and
employer have mutually agreed and that has been approved by the CO.
(ii) The work contract period can be shortened by agreement of the parties only with the approval of the CO.
In the event the worker begins working later than the specified beginning date of the contract, the guarantee period
begins with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment, and continues until the last
day during which the work contract and all extensions thereof are in effect.
(iii) Therefore, if, for example, a work contract is for a 10-week period, during which a normal workweek is
specified as 6 days a week, 8 hours per day, the worker would have to be guaranteed employment for at least 360
hours (10 weeks × 48 hours/week = 480 hours × 75 percent = 360). If a Federal holiday occurred during the 10-week
span, the 8 hours would be deducted from the total hours for the work contract, before the guarantee is calculated.
Continuing with the above example, the worker would have to be guaranteed employment for 354 hours (10 weeks
× 48 hours/week = 480 hours − 8 hours (Federal holiday) × 75 percent = 354 hours).
(iv) A worker may be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday. For purposes of
meeting the guarantee, however, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours
specified in the job order for a workday, or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays. However, all hours of work
actually performed may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of guaranteed employment
has been met. If during the total work contract period the employer affords the U.S. or H-2A worker less
employment than that required under this paragraph, the employer must pay such worker the amount the worker
would have earned had the worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days. An employer will not be
considered to have met the work guarantee if the employer has merely offered work on three-fourths of the
workdays if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as specified in the job order.
(2) Guarantee for piece rate paid worker. If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer must use the
worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the required hourly wage rate, whichever is higher, to calculate the
amount due under the guarantee.
(3) Failure to work. Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in
the job order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work in accordance with paragraph
(i)(1) of this section, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary work over 8 hours in a workday
or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period
of guaranteed employment has been met. An employer seeking to calculate whether the number of hours has been
met must maintain the payroll records in accordance with this subpart.
(4) Displaced H-2A worker. The employer is not liable for payment of the three-fourths guarantee to an H-2A
worker whom the CO certifies is displaced because of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule described
in §655.135(d) with respect to referrals made during that period.
(5) Obligation to provide housing and meals. Notwithstanding the three-fourths guarantee contained in this
section, employers are obligated to provide housing and meals in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (g) of this
section for each day of the contract period up until the day the workers depart for other H-2A employment, depart to
the place outside of the U.S. from which the worker came, or, if the worker voluntarily abandons employment or is
terminated for cause, the day of such abandonment or termination.
(j) Earnings records. (1) The employer must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers'
earnings, including but not limited to field tally records, supporting summary payroll records, and records showing
the nature and amount of the work performed; the number of hours of work offered each day by the employer
(broken out by hours offered both in accordance with and over and above the three-fourths guarantee at paragraph
(i)(3) of this section); the hours actually worked each day by the worker; the time the worker began and ended each
workday; the rate of pay (both piece rate and hourly, if applicable); the worker's earnings per pay period; the
worker's home address; and the amount of and reasons for any and all deductions taken from the worker's wages.

(2) Each employer must keep the records required by this part, including field tally records and supporting
summary payroll records, safe and accessible at the place or places of employment, or at one or more established
central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained. All records must be available for
inspection and transcription by the Secretary or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker
and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation (an Entry of Appearance
as Attorney or Representative, Form G-28, signed by the worker, or an affidavit signed by the worker confirming
such representation). Where the records are maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or
places of employment, such records must be made available for inspection and copying within 72 hours following
notice from the Secretary, or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker and designated
representatives as described in this paragraph.
(3) To assist in determining whether the three-fourths guarantee in paragraph (i) of this section has been met,
if the number of hours worked by the worker on a day during the work contract period is less than the number of
hours offered, as specified in the job offer, the records must state the reason or reasons therefore.
(4) The employer must retain the records for not less than 3 years after the date of the certification.
(k) Hours and earnings statements. The employer must furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one
or more written statements the following information:
(1) The worker's total earnings for the pay period;
(2) The worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(3) The hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three-fourths
guarantee as determined in paragraph (i) of this section, separate from any hours offered over and above the
guarantee);
(4) The hours actually worked by the worker;
(5) An itemization of all deductions made from the worker's wages;
(6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily;
(7) Beginning and ending dates of the pay period; and
(8) The employer's name, address and FEIN.
(l) Rates of pay. If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay the worker at least the AEWR, the
prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, the agreed-upon collective bargaining rate, or the Federal or
State minimum wage rate, in effect at the time work is performed, whichever is highest, for every hour or portion
thereof worked during a pay period.
(1) The offered wage may not be based on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, unless the employer
guarantees a wage paid on a weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly basis that equals or exceeds the AEWR, prevailing
hourly wage or piece rate, the legal Federal or State minimum wage, or any agreed-upon collective bargaining rate,
whichever is highest; or
(2) If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the pay period the piece rate does not result in
average hourly piece rate earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned
had the worker been paid at the appropriate hourly rate:

(i) The worker's pay must be supplemented at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as the
worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage
rate for each hour worked;
(ii) The piece rate must be no less than the piece rate prevailing for the activity in the area of intended
employment; and
(iii) If the employer who pays by the piece rate requires one or more minimum productivity standards of
workers as a condition of job retention, such standards must be specified in the job offer and be no more than those
required by the employer in 1977, unless the OFLC Administrator approves a higher minimum, or, if the employer
first applied for H-2A temporary labor certification after 1977, such standards must be no more than those normally
required (at the time of the first Application for Temporary Employment Certification) by other employers for the
activity in the area of intended employment.
(m) Frequency of pay. The employer must state in the job offer the frequency with which the worker will be
paid, which must be at least twice monthly or according to the prevailing practice in the area of intended
employment, whichever is more frequent. Employers must pay wages when due.
(n) Abandonment of employment or termination for cause. If the worker voluntarily abandons employment
before the end of the contract period, or is terminated for cause, and the employer notifies the NPC, and DHS in the
case of an H-2A worker, in writing or by any other method specified by the Department or DHS in a manner
specified in a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER not later than 2 working days after such abandonment
occurs, the employer will not be responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and
subsistence expenses of that worker under this section, and that worker is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee
described in paragraph (i) of this section. Abandonment will be deemed to begin after a worker fails to report for
work at the regularly scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of the employer.
(o) Contract impossibility. If, before the expiration date specified in the work contract, the services of the
worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of
God that makes the fulfillment of the contract impossible, the employer may terminate the work contract. Whether
such an event constitutes a contract impossibility will be determined by the CO. In the event of such termination of a
contract, the employer must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start of the work
contract to the time of its termination, as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The employer must make
efforts to transfer the worker to other comparable employment acceptable to the worker, consistent with existing
immigration law, as applicable. If such transfer is not affected, the employer must:
(1) Return the worker, at the employer's expense, to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening
employment) came to work for the employer, or transport the worker to the worker's next certified H-2A employer,
whichever the worker prefers;
(2) Reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made from the worker's pay by the employer for
transportation and subsistence expenses to the place of employment; and
(3) Pay the worker for any costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence to that
employer's place of employment. Daily subsistence must be computed as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section.
The amount of the transportation payment must not be less (and is not required to be more) than the most
economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved.
(p) Deductions. (1) The employer must make all deductions from the worker's paycheck required by law. The
job offer must specify all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from the worker's paycheck.
All deductions must be reasonable. The employer may deduct the cost of the worker's transportation and daily
subsistence expenses to the place of employment which were borne directly by the employer. In such circumstances,
the job offer must state that the worker will be reimbursed the full amount of such deduction upon the worker's

completion of 50 percent of the work contract period. However, an employer subject to the FLSA may not make
deductions that would violate the FLSA.
(2) A deduction is not reasonable if it includes a profit to the employer or to any affiliated person. A deduction
that is primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and therefore
the cost of such an item may not be included in computing wages. The wage requirements of §655.120 will not be
met where undisclosed or unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the
employee below the minimum amounts required under this subpart, or where the employee fails to receive such
amounts free and clear because the employee kicks back directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person
for the employer's benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee. The principles applied in
determining whether deductions are reasonable and payments are received free and clear, and the permissibility of
deductions for payments to third persons are explained in more detail in 29 CFR part 531.
(q) Disclosure of work contract. The employer must provide to an H-2A worker no later than the time at
which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work
commences, a copy of the work contract between the employer and the worker in a language understood by the
worker as necessary or reasonable. For an H-2A worker going from an H-2A employer to a subsequent H-2A
employer, the copy must be provided no later than the time an offer of employment is made by the subsequent H-2A
employer. At a minimum, the work contract must contain all of the provisions required by this section. In the
absence of a separate, written work contract entered into between the employer and the worker, the required terms of
the job order and the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be the work contract.

APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION FILING
PROCEDURES
§655.130 Application filing requirements.
All agricultural employers who desire to hire H-2A foreign agricultural workers must apply for a certification
from the Secretary by filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification with the NPC designated by
the OFLC Administrator. The following section provides the procedures employers must follow when filing.
(a) What to file. An employer, whether individual, association, or an H-2ALC, that desires to apply for
temporary employment certification of one or more nonimmigrant foreign workers must file a completed
Application for Temporary Employment Certification form and, unless a specific exemption applies, a copy of Form
ETA-790, submitted to the SWA serving the area of intended employment, as set forth in §655.121(a).
(b) Timeliness. A completed Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be filed no less than
45 calendar days before the employer's date of need.
(c) Location and method of filing. The employer may send the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification and all required supporting documentation by U.S. Mail or private mail courier to the NPC. The
Department will publish a Notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER identifying the address(es), and any future address
changes, to which Applications for Temporary Employment Certification must be mailed, and will also post these
addresses on the OFLC Internet Web site at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/. The Department may also
require Applications for Temporary Employment Certification, at a future date, to be filed electronically in addition
to or instead of by mail, notice of which will be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
(d) Original signature. The Application for Temporary Employment Certification must bear the original
signature of the employer (and that of the employer's authorized attorney or agent if the employer is represented by
an attorney or agent). An association filing a master application as a joint employer may sign on behalf of its
employer members. An association filing as an agent may not sign on behalf of its members but must obtain each
member's signature on each Application for Temporary Employment Certification prior to filing.

(e) Information received in the course of processing Applications for Temporary Employment Certification
and program integrity measures such as audits may be forwarded from OFLC to Wage and Hour Division (WHD)
for enforcement purposes.
§655.131 Association filing requirements.
If an association files an Application for Temporary Employment Certification, in addition to complying with
all the assurances, guarantees, and other requirements contained in this subpart and in part 653, subpart F, of this
chapter, the following requirements also apply.
(a) Individual applications. Associations of agricultural employers may file an Application for Temporary
Employment Certification for H-2A workers as a sole employer, a joint employer, or agent. The association must
identify in the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in what capacity it is filing. The association
must retain documentation substantiating the employer or agency status of the association and be prepared to submit
such documentation in response to a Notice of Deficiency from the CO prior to issuing a Final Determination, or in
the event of an audit.
(b) Master applications. An association may file a master application on behalf of its employer-members. The
master application is available only when the association is filing as a joint employer. An association may submit a
master application covering the same occupation or comparable work available with a number of its employermembers in multiple areas of intended employment, just as though all of the covered employers were in fact a single
employer, as long as a single date of need is provided for all workers requested by the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and all employer-members are located in no more than two contiguous States. The
association must identify on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification by name, address, total
number of workers needed, and the crops and agricultural work to be performed, each employer that will employ H2A workers. The association, as appropriate, will receive a certified Application for Temporary Employment
Certification that can be copied and sent to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) with
each employer-member's petition.
§655.132 H-2A labor contractor (H-2ALC) filing requirements.
If an H-2ALC intends to file an Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the H-2ALC must meet
all of the requirements of the definition of employer in §655.103(b), and comply with all the assurances, guarantees,
and other requirements contained in this part, including Assurances and Obligations of H-2A Employers, and in part
653, subpart F, of this chapter.
(a) Scope of H-2ALC Applications. An Application for Temporary Employment Certification filed by an H2ALC must be limited to a single area of intended employment in which the fixed-site employer(s) to whom an H2ALC is furnishing employees will be utilizing the employees.
(b) Required information and submissions. An H-2ALC must include in or with its Application for Temporary
Employment Certification the following:
(1) The name and location of each fixed-site agricultural business to which the H-2ALC expects to provide H2A workers, the expected beginning and ending dates when the H-2ALC will be providing the workers to each fixed
site, and a description of the crops and activities the workers are expected to perform at such fixed site.
(2) A copy of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) Farm Labor Contractor
(FLC) Certificate of Registration, if required under MSPA at 29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., identifying the specific farm
labor contracting activities the H-2ALC is authorized to perform as an FLC.
(3) Proof of its ability to discharge financial obligations under the H-2A program by including with the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification the original surety bond as required by 29 CFR 501.9. The

bond document must clearly identify the issuer, the name, address, phone number, and contact person for the surety,
and provide the amount of the bond (as calculated pursuant to 29 CFR 501.9) and any identifying designation used
by the surety for the bond.
(4) Copies of the fully-executed work contracts with each fixed-site agricultural business identified under
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(5) Where the fixed-site agricultural business will provide housing or transportation to the workers, proof that:
(i) All housing used by workers and owned, operated or secured by the fixed-site agricultural business
complies with the applicable standards as set forth in §655.122(d) and certified by the SWA; and
(ii) All transportation between the worksite and the workers' living quarters that is provided by the fixed-site
agricultural business complies with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations and must provide, at a
minimum, the same vehicle safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as required under 29 U.S.C.
1841 and 29 CFR 500.105 and 500.120 to 500.128, except where workers' compensation is used to cover such
transportation as described in §655.125(h).
§655.133 Requirements for agents.
(a) An agent filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification on behalf of an employer must
provide a copy of the agent agreement or other document demonstrating the agent's authority to represent the
employer.
(b) In addition the agent must provide a copy of the MSPA FLC Certificate of Registration, if required under
MSPA at 29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., identifying the specific farm labor contracting activities the agent is authorized to
perform.
§655.134 Emergency situations.
(a) Waiver of time period. The CO may waive the time period for filing for employers who did not make use
of temporary alien agricultural workers during the prior year's agricultural season or for any employer that has other
good and substantial cause (which may include unforeseen changes in market conditions), provided that the CO has
sufficient time to test the domestic labor market on an expedited basis to make the determinations required by
§655.100.
(b) Employer requirements. The employer requesting a waiver of the required time period must concurrently
submit to the NPC and to the SWA serving the area of intended employment a completed Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, a completed job order on the Form ETA-790, and a statement justifying the
request for a waiver of the time period requirement. The statement must indicate whether the waiver request is due
to the fact that the employer did not use H-2A workers during the prior agricultural season or whether the request is
for good and substantial cause. If the waiver is requested for good and substantial cause, the employer's statement
must also include detailed information describing the good and substantial cause which has necessitated the waiver
request. Good and substantial cause may include, but is not limited to, the substantial loss of U.S. workers due to
weather-related activities or other reasons, unforeseen events affecting the work activities to be performed,
pandemic health issues, or similar conditions.
(c) Processing of emergency applications. The CO will process emergency Applications for Temporary
Employment Certification in a manner consistent with the provisions set forth in §§655.140 through 655.145 and
make a determination on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in accordance with §§655.160
through 655.167. The CO may advise the employer in writing that the certification cannot be granted because,
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the request for emergency filing was not justified and/or there is not
sufficient time to test the availability of U.S. workers such that the CO can make a determination on the Application

for Temporary Employment Certification in accordance with §655.161. Such notification will so inform the
employer using the procedures applicable to a denial of certification set forth in §655.164.
§655.135 Assurances and obligations of H-2A employers.
An employer seeking to employ H-2A workers must agree as part of the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and job offer that it will abide by the requirements of this subpart and make each of the
following additional assurances:
(a) Non-discriminatory hiring practices. The job opportunity is, and through the period set forth in paragraph
(d) of this section must continue to be, open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin,
age, sex, religion, handicap, or citizenship. Rejections of any U.S. workers who applied or apply for the job must be
only for lawful, job-related reasons, and those not rejected on this basis have been or will be hired. In addition, the
employer has and will continue to retain records of all hires and rejections as required by §655.167.
(b) No strike or lockout. The worksite for which the employer is requesting H-2A certification does not
currently have workers on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor dispute.
(c) Recruitment requirements. The employer has and will continue to cooperate with the SWA by accepting
referrals of all eligible U.S. workers who apply (or on whose behalf an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification is made) for the job opportunity until the end of the period as specified in paragraph (d) of this section
and must independently conduct the positive recruitment activities, as specified in §655.154, until the date on which
the H-2A workers depart for the place of work. Unless the SWA is informed in writing of a different date, the date
that is the third day preceding the employer's first date of need will be determined to be the date the H-2A workers
departed for the employer's place of business.
(d) Fifty percent rule. From the time the foreign workers depart for the employer's place of employment, the
employer must provide employment to any qualified, eligible U.S. worker who applies to the employer until 50
percent of the period of the work contract has elapsed. Start of the work contract timeline is calculated from the first
date of need stated on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, under which the foreign worker
who is in the job was hired. This provision will not apply to any employer who certifies to the CO in the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification that the employer:
(1) Did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of
agricultural labor, as defined in sec. 203(u) of Title 29;
(2) Is not a member of an association which has petitioned for certification under this subpart for its members;
and
(3) Has not otherwise associated with other employers who are petitioning for temporary foreign workers
under this subpart.
(e) Compliance with applicable laws. During the period of employment that is the subject of the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification, the employer must comply with all applicable Federal, State and local
laws and regulations, including health and safety laws. In compliance with such laws, including the William
Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-457, 18 U.S.C. 1592(a), the
employer may not hold or confiscate workers' passports, visas, or other immigration documents. H-2A employers
may also be subject to the FLSA. The FLSA operates independently of the H-2A program and has specific
requirements that address payment of wages, including deductions from wages, the payment of Federal minimum
wage and payment of overtime.
(f) Job opportunity is full-time. The job opportunity is a full-time temporary position, calculated to be at least
35 hours per work week.

(g) No recent or future layoffs. The employer has not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S.
worker in the occupation that is the subject of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in the area
of intended employment except for lawful, job-related reasons within 60 days of the date of need, or if the employer
has laid off such workers, it has offered the job opportunity that is the subject of the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification to those laid-off U.S. worker(s) and the U.S. worker(s) refused the job opportunity, was
rejected for the job opportunity for lawful, job-related reasons, or was hired. A layoff for lawful, job-related reasons
such as lack of work or the end of the growing season is permissible if all H-2A workers are laid off before any U.S.
worker in corresponding employment.
(h) No unfair treatment. The employer has not and will not intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist,
discharge or in any manner discriminate against, and has not and will not cause any person to intimidate, threaten,
restrain, coerce, blacklist, or in any manner discriminate against, any person who has:
(1) Filed a complaint under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1188, or this subpart or any other Department regulation
promulgated thereunder;
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1188 or this subpart or any
other Department regulation promulgated thereunder;
(3) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1188 or this subpart or any
other Department regulation promulgated thereunder;
(4) Consulted with an employee of a legal assistance program or an attorney on matters related to 8 U.S.C.
1188 or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated thereunder; or
(5) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself/herself or others any right or protection afforded by 8 U.S.C.
1188 or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated thereunder.
(i) Notify workers of duty to leave United States. (1) The employer must inform H-2A workers of the
requirement that they leave the U.S. at the end of the period certified by the Department or separation from the
employer, whichever is earlier, as required under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, unless the H-2A worker is being
sponsored by another subsequent H-2A employer.
(2) As defined further in DHS regulations, a temporary labor certification limits the validity period of an H-2A
petition, and therefore, the authorized period of stay for an H-2A worker. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(vii) A foreign
worker may not remain beyond his or her authorized period of stay, as determined by DHS, nor beyond separation
from employment prior to completion of the H-2A contract, absent an extension or change of such worker's status
under DHS regulations. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(viii)(B).
(j) Comply with the prohibition against employees paying fees. The employer and its agents have not sought or
received payment of any kind from any employee subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188 for any activity related to obtaining H2A labor certification, including payment of the employer's attorneys' fees, application fees, or recruitment costs.
For purposes of this paragraph, payment includes, but is not limited to, monetary payments, wage concessions
(including deductions from wages, salary, or benefits), kickbacks, bribes, tributes, in kind payments, and free labor.
This provision does not prohibit employers or their agents from receiving reimbursement for costs that are the
responsibility and primarily for the benefit of the worker, such as government-required passport fees.
(k) Contracts with third parties comply with prohibitions. The employer has contractually forbidden any
foreign labor contractor or recruiter (or any agent of such foreign labor contractor or recruiter) whom the employer
engages, either directly or indirectly, in international recruitment of H-2A workers to seek or receive payments or
other compensation from prospective employees. This documentation is to be made available upon request by the
CO or another Federal party.

(l) Notice of worker rights. The employer must post and maintain in a conspicuous location at the place of
employment, a poster provided by the Secretary in English, and, to the extent necessary, any language common to a
significant portion of the workers if they are not fluent in English, which sets out the rights and protections for
workers employed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1188.

PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION
§655.140 Review of applications.
(a) NPC review. The CO will promptly review the Application for Temporary Employment Certification and
job order for compliance with all applicable program requirements, including compliance with the requirements set
forth in this subpart.
(b) Mailing and postmark requirements. Any notice or request sent by the CO(s) to an employer requiring a
response will be sent using the provided address via traditional methods to assure next day delivery. The employer's
response to such a notice or request must be filed using traditional methods to assure next day delivery and be sent
by the date due or the next business day if the due date falls on a Sunday or Federal Holiday.
§655.141 Notice of deficiency.
(a) Notification timeline. If the CO determines the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job
order are incomplete, contain errors or inaccuracies, or do not meet the requirements set forth in this subpart, the CO
will notify the employer within 7 calendar days of the CO's receipt of the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. A copy of this notification will be sent to the SWA serving the area of intended employment.
(b) Notice content. The notice will:
(1) State the reason(s) why the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job order fails to meet
the criteria for acceptance;
(2) Offer the employer an opportunity to submit a modified Application for Temporary Employment
Certification or job order within 5 business days from date of receipt stating the modification that is needed for the
CO to issue the Notice of Acceptance;
(3) Except as provided for under the expedited review or de novo administrative hearing provisions of this
section, state that the CO's determination on whether to grant or deny the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification will be made no later than 30 calendar days before the date of need, provided that the employer
submits the requested modification to the Application for Temporary Employment Certification within 5 business
days and in a manner specified by the CO;
(4) Offer the employer an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ of the Notice of Deficiency. The notice will state that in order to obtain such a
review or hearing, the employer, within 5 business days of the receipt of the notice, must file by facsimile or other
means normally assuring next day delivery a written request to the Chief ALJ of DOL and simultaneously serve a
copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may submit any legal arguments that the employer
believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and
(5) State that if the employer does not comply with the requirements of §655.142 or request an expedited
administrative review or a de novo hearing before an ALJ within 5 business days the CO will deny the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification. That denial is final cannot be appealed and the Department will not
further consider that Application for Temporary Employment Certification.

(c) Appeal from Notice of Deficiency. The employer may timely request an expedited administrative review or
de novo hearing before an ALJ by following the procedures set forth in §655.171.
§655.142 Submission of modified applications.
(a) Submission requirements and certification delays. If the employer chooses to submit a modified
Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the CO's Final Determination will be postponed by 1 calendar
day for each day that passes beyond the 5 business-day period allowed under §655.141(b) to submit a modified
Application for Temporary Employment Certification, up to maximum of 5 days. The Application for Temporary
Employment Certification will be deemed abandoned if the employer does not submit a modified Application for
Temporary Employment Certification within 12 calendar days after the notice of deficiency was issued.
(b) Provisions for denial of modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification. If the modified
Application for Temporary Employment Certification is not approved, the CO will deny the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification in accordance with the labor certification determination provisions in
§655.164.
(c) Appeal from denial of modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The procedures for
appealing a denial of a modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification are the same as for a nonmodified Application for Temporary Employment Certification as long as the employer timely requests an expedited
administrative review or de novo hearing before an ALJ by following the procedures set forth in §655.171.
§655.143 Notice of acceptance.
(a) Notification timeline. When the CO determines the Application for Temporary Employment Certification
and job order are complete and meet the requirements set forth in this subpart, the CO will notify the employer
within 7 calendar days of the CO's receipt of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. A copy will
be sent to the SWA serving the area of intended employment.
(b) Notice content. The notice must:
(1) Authorize conditional access to the interstate clearance system and direct the SWA to circulate a copy of
the job order to other such States the CO determines to be potential sources of U.S. workers;
(2) Direct the employer to engage in positive recruitment of U.S. workers in a manner consistent with
§655.154 and to submit a report of its positive recruitment efforts as specified in §655.156;
(3) State that positive recruitment is in addition to and will occur during the period of time that the job order is
being circulated by the SWA(s) for interstate clearance under §655.150 of this subpart and will terminate on the
actual date on which the H-2A workers depart for the place of work, or 3 calendar days prior to the first date the
employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, whichever occurs first; and
(4) State that the CO will make a determination either to grant or deny the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification no later than 30 calendar days before the date of need, except as provided for under
§655.144 for modified Applications for Temporary Employment Certification.
§655.144 Electronic job registry.
(a) Location of and placement in the electronic job registry. Upon acceptance of the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification under §655.143, the CO will promptly place for public examination a copy of
the job order on an electronic job registry maintained by the Department, including any required modifications
approved by the CO, as specified in §655.142. This procedure will be implemented once the Department initiates
operation of the registry.

(b) Length of posting on electronic job registry. Unless otherwise provided, the Department will keep the job
order posted on the Electronic Job Registry until the end of 50 percent of the contract period as set forth in
§655.135(d).
§655.145 Amendments to applications for temporary employment certification.
(a) Increases in number of workers. The Application for Temporary Employment Certification may be
amended at any time before the CO's certification determination to increase the number of workers requested in the
initial Application for Temporary Employment Certification by not more than 20 percent (50 percent for employers
requesting less than 10 workers) without requiring an additional recruitment period for U.S. workers. Requests for
increases above the percent prescribed, without additional recruitment, may be approved by the CO only when the
employer demonstrates that the need for additional workers could not have been foreseen, and the crops or
commodities will be in jeopardy prior to the expiration of an additional recruitment period. All requests for
increasing the number of workers must be made in writing.
(b) Minor changes to the period of employment. The Application for Temporary Employment Certification
may be amended to make minor changes in the total period of employment. Changes will not be effective until
submitted in writing and approved by the CO. In considering whether to approve the request, the CO will review the
reason(s) for the request, determine whether the reason(s) are on the whole justified, and take into account the effect
any change(s) would have on the adequacy of the underlying test of the domestic labor market for the job
opportunity. An employer must demonstrate that the change to the period of employment could not have been
foreseen, and the crops or commodities will be in jeopardy prior to the expiration of an additional recruitment
period. If the request is for a delay in the start date and is made after workers have departed for the employer's place
of work, the CO may only approve the change if the employer includes with the request a written assurance signed
and dated by the employer that all workers who are already traveling to the job site will be provided housing and
subsistence, without cost to the workers, until work commences. Upon acceptance of an amendment, the CO will
submit to the SWA any necessary modification to the job order.

POST-ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS
§655.150 Interstate clearance of job order.
(a) SWA posts in interstate clearance system. The SWA must promptly place the job order in interstate
clearance to all States designated by the CO. At a minimum, the CO will instruct the SWA to transmit a copy of its
active job order to all States listed in the job order as anticipated worksites covering the area of intended
employment.
(b) Duration of posting. Each of the SWAs to which the job order was transmitted must keep the job order on
its active file until 50 percent of the contract term has elapsed, and must refer each qualified U.S. worker who
applies (or on whose behalf an application is made) for the job opportunity.
§655.151 Newspaper advertisements.
(a) The employer must place an advertisement (in a language other than English, where the CO determines
appropriate) on 2 separate days, which may be consecutive, one of which must be a Sunday (except as provided in
paragraph (b) of this section), in a newspaper of general circulation serving the area of intended employment and is
appropriate to the occupation and the workers likely to apply for the job opportunity. Newspaper advertisements
must satisfy the requirements set forth in §655.152.
(b) If the job opportunity is located in a rural area that does not have a newspaper with a Sunday edition, the
CO may direct the employer, in place of a Sunday edition, to advertise in the regularly published daily edition with
the widest circulation in the area of intended employment.

§655.152 Advertising requirements.
All advertising conducted to satisfy the required recruitment activities under §655.151 must meet the
requirements set forth in this section and must contain terms and conditions of employment which are not less
favorable than those offered to the H-2A workers. All advertising must contain the following information:
(a) The employer's name, or in the event that a master application will be filed by an association, a statement
indicating that the name and location of each member of the association can be obtained from the SWA of the State
in which the advertisement is run;
(b) The geographic area of intended employment with enough specificity to apprise applicants of any travel
requirements and where applicants will likely have to reside to perform the services or labor;
(c) A description of the job opportunity for which certification is sought with sufficient information to apprise
U.S. workers of services or labor to be performed and the anticipated start and end dates of employment of the job
opportunity;
(d) The wage offer, or in the event that there are multiple wage offers (such as where a master application will
be filed by an association and/or where there are multiple crop activities for a single employer), the range of
applicable wage offers and, where a master application will be filed by an association, a statement indicating that the
rate(s) applicable to each employer can be obtained from the SWA of the State in which the advertisement is run;
(e) The three-fourths guarantee specified in §655.122(i);
(f) If applicable, a statement that work tools, supplies, and equipment will be provided at no cost to the
worker;
(g) A statement that housing will be made available at no cost to workers, including U.S. workers who cannot
reasonably return to their permanent residence at the end of each working day;
(h) A statement that transportation and subsistence expenses to the worksite will be provided by the employer
or paid by the employer upon completion of 50 percent of the work contract, or earlier, if appropriate;
(i) A statement that the position is temporary and a specification of the total number of job openings the
employer intends to fill;
(j) A statement directing applicants to apply for the job opportunity at the nearest office of the SWA in the
State in which the advertisement appeared. Employers who wish to require interviews must conduct those interviews
by phone or provide a procedure for the interviews to be conducted in the location where the worker is being
recruited at little or no cost to the worker. Employers cannot provide potential H-2A workers more favorable
treatment with respect to the requirement and conduct of interviews; and
(k) Contact information for the applicable SWA and, if available, the job order number.
§655.153 Contact with former U.S. employees.
The employer must contact, by mail or other effective means, its former U.S. workers (except those who were
dismissed for cause or who abandoned the worksite) employed by the employer in the occupation at the place of
employment during the previous year and solicit their return to the job. This contact must occur during the period of
time that the job order is being circulated by the SWA(s) for interstate clearance and documentation sufficient to
prove contact must be maintained in the event of an audit.
§655.154 Additional positive recruitment.

(a) Where to conduct additional positive recruitment. The employer must conduct positive recruitment within
a multistate region of traditional or expected labor supply where the CO finds that there are a significant number of
qualified U.S. workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work at the time and
place needed.
(b) Additional requirements should be comparable to non-H-2A employers in the area. The CO will ensure
that the effort, including the location(s) and method(s) of the positive recruitment required of the potential H-2A
employer must be no less than the normal recruitment efforts of non-H-2A agricultural employers of comparable or
smaller size in the area of intended employment, and the kind and degree of recruitment efforts which the potential
H-2A employer made to obtain foreign workers.
(c) Nature of the additional positive recruitment. The CO will describe the precise nature of the additional
positive recruitment but the employer will not be required to conduct positive recruitment in more than three States
for each area of intended employment listed on the employer's application.
(d) Proof of recruitment. The CO will specify the documentation or other supporting evidence that must be
maintained by the employer as proof that the positive recruitment requirements were met.
§655.155 Referrals of U.S. workers.
SWAs may only refer for employment individuals who have been apprised of all the material terms and
conditions of employment and have indicated, by accepting referral to the job opportunity, that he or she is qualified,
able, willing, and available for employment.
§655.156 Recruitment report.
(a) Requirements of a recruitment report. The employer must prepare, sign, and date a written recruitment
report. The recruitment report must be submitted on a date specified by the CO in the Notice of Acceptance set forth
in §655.141 and contain the following information:
(1) Identify the name of each recruitment source;
(2) State the name and contact information of each U.S. worker who applied or was referred to the job
opportunity up to the date of the preparation of the recruitment report, and the disposition of each worker;
(3) Confirm that former U.S. employees were contacted and by what means; and
(4) If applicable, for each U.S. worker who applied for the position but was not hired, explain the lawful jobrelated reason(s) for not hiring the U.S. worker.
(b) Duty to update recruitment report. The employer must continue to maintain the recruitment report
throughout the recruitment period including the 50 percent period. The updated report is not to be automatically
submitted to the Department, but must be made available in the event of a post-certification audit or upon request by
authorized representatives of the Secretary.
§655.157 Withholding of U.S. workers prohibited.
(a) Filing a complaint. Any employer who has reason to believe that a person or entity has willfully and
knowingly withheld U.S. workers prior to the arrival at the worksite of H-2A workers in order to force the hiring of
U.S. workers during the recruitment period, as set forth in §655.135(d), may submit a written complaint to the CO.
The complaint must clearly identify the person or entity who the employer believes has withheld the U.S. workers,
and must specify sufficient facts to support the allegation (e.g., dates, places, numbers and names of U.S. workers)
which will permit an investigation to be conducted by the CO.

(b) Duty to investigate. Upon receipt, the CO must immediately investigate the complaint. The investigation
must include interviews with the employer who has submitted the complaint, the person or entity named as
responsible for withholding the U.S. workers, and the individual U.S. workers whose availability has purportedly
been withheld.
(c) Duty to suspend the recruitment period. Where the CO determines, after conducting the interviews
required by paragraph (b) of this section, that the employer's complaint is valid and justified, the CO will
immediately suspend the application of the 50 percent rule of the recruitment period, as set forth in §655.135(d), to
the employer. The CO's determination is the final decision of the Secretary.
§655.158 Duration of positive recruitment.
Except as otherwise noted, the obligation to engage in positive recruitment described in §§655.150 through
655.154 shall terminate on the date H-2A workers depart for the employer's place of work. Unless the SWA is
informed in writing of a different date, the date that is the third day preceding the employer's first date of need will
be determined to be the date the H-2A workers departed for the employer's place of business.

LABOR CERTIFICATION DETERMINATIONS
§655.160 Determinations.
Except as otherwise noted in this section, the CO will make a determination either to grant or deny the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification no later than 30 calendar days before the date of need
identified in the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. An Application for Temporary Employment
Certification that is modified under §655.142 or that otherwise does not meet the requirements for certification in
this subpart is not subject to the 30-day timeframe for certification.
§655.161 Criteria for certification.
(a) The criteria for certification include whether the employer has established the need for the agricultural
services or labor to be performed on a temporary or seasonal basis; complied with the requirements of parts 653 and
654 of this chapter; complied with all of this subpart, including but not limited to the timeliness requirements in
§655.130(b); complied with the offered wage rate criteria in §655.120; made all the assurances in §655.135; and met
all the recruitment obligations required by §655.121 and §655.152.
(b) In making a determination as to whether there are insufficient U.S. workers to fill the employer's job
opportunity, the CO will count as available any U.S. worker referred by the SWA or any U.S. worker who applied
(or on whose behalf an application is made) directly to the employer, but who was rejected by the employer for other
than a lawful job-related reason or who has not been provided with a lawful job-related reason for rejection by the
employer.
§655.162 Approved certification.
If temporary labor certification is granted, the CO will send the certified Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and a Final Determination letter to the employer by means normally assuring next-day
delivery and a copy, if appropriate, to the employer's agent or attorney.
§655.163 Certification fee.
A determination by the CO to grant an Application for Temporary Employment Certification in whole or in
part will include a bill for the required certification fees. Each employer of H-2A workers under the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification (except joint employer associations, which may not be assessed a fee in
addition to the fees assessed to the members of the association) must pay in a timely manner a non-refundable fee

upon issuance of the certification granting the Application for Temporary Employment Certification (in whole or in
part), as follows:
(a) Amount. The Application for Temporary Employment Certification fee for each employer receiving a
temporary agricultural labor certification is $100 plus $10 for each H-2A worker certified under the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, provided that the fee to an employer for each temporary agricultural labor
certification received will be no greater than $1,000. There is no additional fee to the association filing the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The fees must be paid by check or money order made payable
to United States Department of Labor. In the case of an agricultural association acting as a joint employer applying
on behalf of its H-2A employer members, the aggregate fees for all employers of H-2A workers under the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be paid by one check or money order.
(b) Timeliness. Fees must be received by the CO no more than 30 days after the date of the certification. Nonpayment or untimely payment may be considered a substantial violation subject to the procedures in §655.182.
§655.164 Denied certification.
If temporary labor certification is denied, the Final Determination letter will be sent to the employer by means
normally assuring next-day delivery and a copy, if appropriate, to the employer's agent or attorney. The Final
Determination Letter will:
(a) State the reason(s) certification is denied;
(b) Offer the applicant an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review, or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ, of the denial. The notice must state that in order to obtain such a review or
hearing, the employer, within 7 calendar days of the date of the notice, must file by facsimile (fax), or other means
normally assuring next day delivery, a written request to the Chief ALJ of DOL (giving the address) and
simultaneously serve a copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may submit any legal arguments
which the employer believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and
(c) State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing
before an ALJ within the 7 calendar days, the denial is final and the Department will not further consider that
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
§655.165 Partial certification.
The CO may issue a partial certification, reducing either the period of need or the number of H-2A workers
being requested or both for certification, based upon information the CO receives during the course of processing
the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, an audit, or otherwise. The number of workers certified
will be reduced by one for each referred U.S. worker who is able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at
the time and place needed and has not been rejected for lawful job-related reasons, to perform the services or labor.
If a partial labor certification is issued, the Final Determination letter will:
(a) State the reason(s) why either the period of need and/or the number of H-2A workers requested has been
reduced;
(b) Offer the applicant an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review, or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ, of the decision. The notice will state that in order to obtain such a review or
hearing, the employer, within 7 calendar days of the date of the notice, will file by facsimile or other means
normally assuring next day delivery a written request to the Chief ALJ of DOL (giving the address) and
simultaneously serve a copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may submit any legal arguments
which the employer believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and

(c) State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing
before an ALJ within the 7 calendar days, the partial certification is final and the Department will not further
consider that Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
§655.166 Requests for determinations based on nonavailability of U.S. workers.
(a) Standards for requests. If a temporary labor certification has been partially granted or denied based on the
CO's determination that able, willing, available, eligible, and qualified U.S. workers are available, and, on or after
30 calendar days before the date of need, some or all of those U.S. workers are, in fact, no longer able, willing,
eligible, qualified, or available, the employer may request a new temporary labor certification determination from
the CO. Prior to making a new determination the CO will promptly ascertain (which may be through the SWA or
other sources of information on U.S. worker availability) whether specific able, willing, eligible and qualified
replacement U.S. workers are available or can be reasonably expected to be present at the employer's establishment
within 72 hours from the date the employer's request was received. The CO will expeditiously, but in no case later
than 72 hours after the time a complete request (including the signed statement included in paragraph (b) of this
section) is received, make a determination on the request. An employer may appeal a denial of such a determination
in accordance with the procedures contained in §655.171.
(b) Unavailability of U.S. workers. The employer's request for a new determination must be made directly to
the CO by telephone or electronic mail, and must be confirmed by the employer in writing as required by this
paragraph. If the employer telephonically or via electronic mail requests the new determination by asserting solely
that U.S. workers have become unavailable, the employer must submit to the CO a signed statement confirming
such assertion. If such signed statement is not received by the CO within 72 hours of the CO's receipt of the request
for a new determination, the CO will deny the request.
(c) Notification of determination. If the CO determines that U.S. workers have become unavailable and cannot
identify sufficient available U.S. workers who are able, willing, eligible, and qualified or who are likely to become
available, the CO will grant the employer's request for a new determination. However, this does not preclude an
employer from submitting subsequent requests for new determinations, if warranted, based on subsequent facts
concerning purported nonavailability of U.S. workers or referred workers not being eligible workers or not able,
willing, or qualified because of lawful job-related reasons.
§655.167 Document retention requirements.
(a) Entities required to retain documents. All employers filing an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification requesting H-2A agricultural workers under this subpart are required to retain the documents and
records proving compliance with this subpart.
(b) Period of required retention. Records and documents must be retained for a period of 3 years from the date
of certification of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or from the date of determination if the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification is denied or withdrawn.
(c) Documents and records to be retained by all applicants. (1) Proof of recruitment efforts, including:
(i) Job order placement as specified in §655.121;
(ii) Advertising as specified in §655.152, or, if used, professional, trade, or ethnic publications;
(iii) Contact with former U.S. workers as specified in §655.153; or
(iv) Additional positive recruitment efforts (as specified in §655.154).

(2) Substantiation of information submitted in the recruitment report prepared in accordance with §655.156,
such as evidence of nonapplicability of contact of former employees as specified in §655.153.
(3) The final recruitment report and any supporting resumes and contact information as specified in
§655.156(b).
(4) Proof of workers' compensation insurance or State law coverage as specified in §655.122(e).
(5) Records of each worker's earnings as specified in §655.122(j).
(6) The work contract or a copy of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification as defined in 29
CFR 501.10 and specified in §655.122(q).
(d) Additional retention requirement for associations filing Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. In addition to the documents specified in paragraph (c) above, Associations must retain documentation
substantiating their status as an employer or agent, as specified in §655.131.

POST CERTIFICATION
§655.170 Extensions.
An employer may apply for extensions of the period of employment in the following circumstances.
(a) Short-term extension. Employers seeking extensions of 2 weeks or less of the certified Application for
Temporary Employment Certification must apply directly to DHS for approval. If granted, the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification will be deemed extended for such period as is approved by DHS.
(b) Long-term extension. Employers seeking extensions of more than 2 weeks may apply to the CO. Such
requests must be related to weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the employer (which may
include unforeseen changes in market conditions). Such requests must be supported in writing, with documentation
showing that the extension is needed and that the need could not have been reasonably foreseen by the employer.
The CO will notify the employer of the decision in writing if time allows, or will otherwise notify the employer of
the decision. The CO will not grant an extension where the total work contract period under that Application for
Temporary Employment Certification and extensions would be 12 months or more, except in extraordinary
circumstances. The employer may appeal a denial of a request for an extension by following the procedures in
§655.171.
(c) Disclosure. The employer must provide to the workers a copy of any approved extension in accordance
with §655.122(q), as soon as practicable.
§655.171 Appeals.
Where authorized in this subpart, employers may request an administrative review or de novo hearing before
an ALJ of a decision by the CO. In such cases, the CO will send a copy of the OFLC administrative file to the Chief
ALJ by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The Chief ALJ will immediately assign an ALJ (which may be
a panel of such persons designated by the Chief ALJ from the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals
(BALCA)).
(a) Administrative review. Where the employer has requested administrative review, within 5 business days
after receipt of the ETA administrative file the ALJ will, on the basis of the written record and after due
consideration of any written submissions (which may not include new evidence) from the parties involved or amici
curiae, either affirm, reverse, or modify the CO's decision, or remand to the CO for further action. The decision of
the ALJ must specify the reasons for the action taken and must be immediately provided to the employer, the CO,

the OFLC Administrator and DHS by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final
decision of the Secretary.
(b) De novo hearing—(1) Conduct of hearing. Where the employer has requested a de novo hearing the
procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to such hearings, except that:
(i) The appeal will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is required;
(ii) The ALJ will ensure that the hearing is scheduled to take place within 5 business days after the ALJ's
receipt of the OFLC administrative file, if the employer so requests, and will allow for the introduction of new
evidence; and
(iii) The ALJ's decision must be rendered within 10 calendar days after the hearing.
(2) Decision. After a de novo hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the CO's determination, or
remand to the CO for further action. The decision of the ALJ must specify the reasons for the action taken and must
be immediately provided to the employer, CO, OFLC Administrator and DHS by means normally assuring next-day
delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final decision of the Secretary.
§655.172 Withdrawal of job order and application for temporary employment certification.
(a) Employers may withdraw a job order from intrastate posting if the employer no longer plans to file an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification. However, a withdrawal of a job order does not nullify
existing obligations to those workers recruited in connection with the placement of a job order pursuant to this
subpart or the filing of an Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(b) Employers may withdraw an Application for Temporary Employment Certification once it has been
formally accepted by the NPC. However, the employer is still obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of
employment contained in the Application for Temporary Employment Certification with respect to workers recruited
in connection with that application.
§655.173 Setting meal charges; petition for higher meal charges.
(a) Meal charges. Until a new amount is set under this paragraph, an employer may charge workers up to
$10.64 for providing them with three meals per day. The maximum charge allowed by this paragraph (a) will be
changed annually by the same percentage as the 12 month percentage change for the Consumer Price Index for all
Urban Consumers for Food between December of the year just concluded and December of the year prior to that.
The annual adjustments will be effective on the date of their publication by the OFLC Administrator as a Notice in
the FEDERAL REGISTER. When a charge or deduction for the cost of meals would bring the employee's wage below
the minimum wage set by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. 206 the charge or deduction must meet the requirements of 29
U.S.C. 203(m) of the FLSA, including the recordkeeping requirements found at 29 CFR 516.27.
(b) Filing petitions for higher meal charges. The employer may file a petition with the CO to charge more
than the applicable amount for meal charges if the employer justifies the charges and submits to the CO the
documentation required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(1) Documentation submitted must include the cost of goods and services directly related to the preparation
and serving of meals, the number of workers fed, the number of meals served and the number of days meals were
provided. The cost of the following items may be included: Food; kitchen supplies other than food, such as lunch
bags and soap; labor costs that have a direct relation to food service operations, such as wages of cooks and dining
hall supervisors; fuel, water, electricity, and other utilities used for the food service operation; and other costs
directly related to the food service operation. Charges for transportation, depreciation, overhead and similar charges

may not be included. Receipts and other cost records for a representative pay period must be retained and must be
available for inspection by the CO for a period of 1 year.
(2) The employer may begin charging the higher rate upon receipt of a favorable decision from the CO unless
the CO sets a later effective date in the decision.
(c) Appeal rights. In the event the employer's petition for a higher meal charge is denied in whole or in part,
the employer may appeal the denial. Appeals will be filed with the Chief ALJ, pursuant to §655.171.
§655.174 Public disclosure.
The Department will maintain an electronic file accessible to the public with information on all employers
applying for temporary agricultural labor certifications. The database will include such information as the number of
workers requested, the date filed, the date decided, and the final disposition.

INTEGRITY MEASURES
§655.180 Audit.
The CO may conduct audits of applications for which certifications have been granted.
(a) Discretion. The applications selected for audit will be chosen within the sole discretion of the CO.
(b) Audit letter. Where an application is selected for audit, the CO will issue an audit letter to the employer
and a copy, if appropriate, to the employer's agent or attorney. The audit letter will:
(1) State the documentation that must be submitted by the employer;
(2) Specify a date no more than 30 days from the date of the audit letter by which the required documentation
must be received by the CO; and
(3) Advise that failure to comply with the audit process may result in the revocation of the certification or
program debarment.
(c) Supplemental information request. During the course of the audit examination, the CO may request
supplemental information and/or documentation from the employer in order to complete the audit.
(d) Potential referrals. In addition to steps in this subpart, the CO may determine to provide the audit findings
and underlying documentation to DHS or another appropriate enforcement agency. The CO will refer any findings
that an employer discouraged an eligible U.S. worker from applying, or failed to hire, discharged, or otherwise
discriminated against an eligible U.S. worker, to the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office of Special
Counsel for Unfair Immigration Related Employment Practices.
§655.181 Revocation.
(a) Basis for DOL revocation. The OFLC Administrator may revoke a temporary agricultural labor
certification approved under this subpart, if the OFLC Administrator finds:
(1) The issuance of the temporary agricultural labor certification was not justified due to fraud or
misrepresentation in the application process;

(2) The employer substantially violated a material term or condition of the approved temporary agricultural
labor certification, as defined in §655.182;
(3) The employer failed to cooperate with a DOL investigation or with a DOL official performing an
investigation, inspection, audit (as discussed in §655.180), or law enforcement function under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29
CFR part 501, or this subpart; or
(4) The employer failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the WHD, or with one
or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court order secured by the Secretary under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR
part 501, or this subpart.
(b) DOL procedures for revocation. (1) Notice of Revocation. If the OFLC Administrator makes a
determination to revoke an employer's temporary labor certification, the OFLC Administrator will send to the
employer (and its attorney or agent) a Notice of Revocation. The Notice will contain a detailed statement of the
grounds for the revocation, and it will inform the employer of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or to appeal. If the
employer does not file rebuttal evidence or an appeal within 14 days of the date of the Notice of Revocation, the
Notice is the final agency action and will take effect immediately at the end of the 14-day period.
(2) Rebuttal. The employer may submit evidence to rebut the grounds stated in the Notice of Revocation
within 14 calendar days of the date the Notice is issued. If rebuttal evidence is timely filed by the employer, the
OFLC Administrator will inform the employer of the OFLC Administrator's final determination on the revocation
within 14 calendar days of receiving the rebuttal evidence. If the OFLC Administrator determines that the
certification should be revoked, the OFLC Administrator will inform the employer of its right to appeal according to
the procedures of §655.171. The employer must file the appeal within 10 calendar days after the OFLC
Administrator's final determination, or the OFLC Administrator's determination is the final agency action and will
take effect immediately at the end of the 10-day period.
(3) Appeal. An employer may appeal a Notice of Revocation, or a final determination of the OFLC
Administrator after the review of rebuttal evidence, according to the appeal procedures of §655.171. The ALJ's
decision is the final agency action.
(4) Stay. The timely filing of rebuttal evidence or an administrative appeal will stay the revocation pending the
outcome of those proceedings.
(5) Decision. If the temporary agricultural labor certification is revoked, the OFLC Administrator will send a
copy of the final agency action of the Secretary to DHS and the Department of State (DOS).
(c) Employer's obligations in the event of revocation. If an employer's temporary agricultural labor
certification is revoked pursuant to this section, the employer is responsible for:
(1) Reimbursement of actual inbound transportation and subsistence expenses, as if the worker meets the
requirements for payment under §655.122(h)(1);
(2) The worker's outbound transportation expenses, as if the worker meets the requirements for payment under
§655.122(h)(2);
(3) Payment to the worker of the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee as required by §655.122(i); and
(4) Any other wages, benefits, and working conditions due or owing to the worker under this subpart.
§655.182 Debarment.

(a) Debarment of an employer. The OFLC Administrator may debar an employer or any successor in interest
to that employer from receiving future labor certifications under this subpart, subject to the time limits set forth in
paragraph (c) of this section, if the OFLC Administrator finds that the employer substantially violated a material
term or condition of its temporary labor certification, with respect to H-2A workers, workers in corresponding
employment, or U.S. workers improperly rejected for employment, or improperly laid off or displaced.
(b) Debarment of an agent or attorney. The OFLC Administrator may debar an agent or attorney from
participating in any action under 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or 29 CFR part 501, if the OFLC Administrator finds
that the agent or attorney participated in an employer's substantial violation. The OFLC Administrator may not issue
future labor certifications under this subpart to any employer represented by a debarred agent or attorney, subject to
the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Statute of limitations and period of debarment. (1) The OFLC Administrator must issue any Notice of
Debarment no later than 2 years after the occurrence of the violation.
(2) No employer, attorney, or agent may be debarred under this subpart for more than 3 years from the date of
the final agency decision.
(d) Definition of violation. For the purposes of this section, a violation includes:
(1) One or more acts of commission or omission on the part of the employer or the employer's agent which
involve:
(i) Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits or working conditions to the employer's H-2A
workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;
(ii) Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied
for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;
(iii) Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;
(iv) Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;
(v) Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the WHD Administrator for

(vi) Impeding an investigation of an employer under 8 U.S.C. 1188 or 29 CFR part 501, or an audit under
§655.180 of this subpart;
(vii) Employing an H-2A worker outside the area of intended employment, in an activity/activities not listed in
the job order or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension
thereof;
(viii) A violation of the requirements of §655.135(j) or (k);
(ix) A violation of any of the provisions listed in 29 CFR 501.4(a); or
(x) A single heinous act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program
requirements cannot reasonably be expected;
(2) The employer's failure to pay a necessary certification fee in a timely manner;

(3) Fraud involving the Application for Temporary Employment Certification; or
(4) A material misrepresentation of fact during the application process.
(e) Determining whether a violation is substantial. In determining whether a violation is so substantial so as to
merit debarment, the factors the OFLC Administrator may consider include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation(s) of 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this subpart;
(2) The number of H-2A workers, workers in corresponding employment, or U.S. workers who were and/or
are affected by the violation(s);
(3) The gravity of the violation(s);
(4) Efforts made in good faith to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, and this subpart;
(5) Explanation from the person charged with the violation(s);
(6) Commitment to future compliance, taking into account the public health, interest, or safety, and whether
the person has previously violated 8 U.S.C. 1188;
(7) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation(s), or the potential financial
loss or potential injury to the worker(s).
(f) Debarment procedure—(1) Notice of Debarment. If the OFLC Administrator makes a determination to
debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the OFLC Administrator will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The
Notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the
duration of the debarment, and it will inform the party subject to the Notice of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or
to request a debarment hearing. If the party does not file rebuttal evidence or request a hearing within 30 calendar
days of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the Notice will be the final agency action and the debarment will take
effect at the end of the 30-day period.
(2) Rebuttal. The party who received the Notice of Debarment may choose to submit evidence to rebut the
grounds stated in the Notice within 30 calendar days of the date the Notice is issued. If rebuttal evidence is timely
filed, the OFLC Administrator will issue a final determination on the debarment within 30 days of receiving the
rebuttal evidence. If the OFLC Administrator determines that the party should be debarred, the OFLC Administrator
will inform the party of its right to request a debarment hearing according to the procedures of §655.182(f)(3). The
party must request a hearing within 30 calendar days after the date of the OFLC Administrator's final determination,
or the OFLC Administrator's determination will be the final agency order and the debarment will take effect at the
end of the 30-day period.
(3) Hearing. The recipient of a Notice of Debarment may request a debarment hearing within 30 calendar days
of the date of a Notice of Debarment or the date of a final determination of the OFLC Administrator after review of
rebuttal evidence submitted pursuant to §655.182(f)(2). To obtain a debarment hearing, the debarred party must,
within 30 days of the date of the Notice or the final determination, file a written request to the Chief Administrative
Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street, NW., Suite 400-N, Washington, DC 20001-8002, and
simultaneously serve a copy to the OFLC Administrator. The debarment will take effect 30 days from the date the
Notice of Debarment or final determination is issued, unless a request for review is properly filed within 30 days
from the issuance of the Notice of Debarment or final determination. The timely filing of a request for a hearing
stays the debarment pending the outcome of the hearing. Within 10 days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the
OFLC Administrator will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief ALJ by means normally assuring
next-day delivery. The Chief ALJ will immediately assign an ALJ to conduct the hearing. The procedures in 29 CFR

part 18 apply to such hearings, except that the request for a hearing will not be considered to be a complaint to
which an answer is required.
(4) Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the OFLC Administrator's
determination. The ALJ will prepare the decision within 60 days after completion of the hearing and closing of the
record. The ALJ's decision will be provided immediately to the parties to the debarment hearing by means normally
assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final agency action, unless either party, within 30 calendar
days of the ALJ's decision, seeks review of the decision with the Administrative Review Board (ARB).
(5) Review by the ARB. (i) Any party wishing review of the decision of an ALJ must, within 30 days of the
decision of the ALJ, petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition must be served on all parties and
on the ALJ. The ARB will decide whether to accept the petition within 30 days of receipt. If the ARB declines to
accept the petition, or if the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition within 30 days after the receipt of a
timely filing of the petition, the decision of the ALJ will be deemed the final agency action. If a petition for review
is accepted, the decision of the ALJ will be stayed unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the decision.
The ARB must serve notice of its decision to accept or not to accept the petition upon the ALJ and upon all parties
to the proceeding.
(ii) Upon receipt of the ARB's notice to accept the petition, the Office of Administrative Law Judges will
promptly forward a copy of the complete hearing record to the ARB.
(iii) Where the ARB has determined to review such decision and order, the ARB will notify each party of the
issue(s) raised, the form in which submissions must be made (e.g., briefs or oral argument), and the time within
which such presentation must be submitted.
(6) ARB decision. The ARB's final decision must be issued within 90 days from the notice granting the
petition and served upon all parties and the ALJ. If the ARB fails to provide a decision within 90 days from the
notice granting the petition, the ALJ's decision will be the final agency decision.
(g) Concurrent debarment jurisdiction. OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction to impose a
debarment remedy under this section or under 29 CFR 501.20. When considering debarment, OFLC and the WHD
may inform one another and may coordinate their activities. A specific violation for which debarment is imposed
will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS
promptly.
(h) Debarment involving members of associations. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an individual
employer-member of a joint employer association has committed a substantial violation, the debarment
determination will apply only to that member unless the OFLC Administrator determines that the association or
another association member participated in the violation, in which case the debarment will be invoked against the
association or other complicit association member(s) as well.
(i) Debarment involving associations acting as joint employers. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an
association acting as a joint employer with its members has committed a substantial violation, the debarment
determination will apply only to the association, and will not be applied to any individual employer-member of the
association. However, if the OFLC Administrator determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or
had reason to know of the violation, the debarment may be invoked against the complicit association member as
well. An association debarred from the H-2A temporary labor certification program will not be permitted to continue
to file as a joint employer with its members during the period of the debarment.
(j) Debarment involving associations acting as sole employers. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an
association acting as a sole employer has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply
only to the association and any successor in interest to the debarred association.
§655.183 Less than substantial violations.

(a) Requirement of special procedures. If the OFLC Administrator determines that a less than substantial
violation has occurred, but the OFLC Administrator has reason to believe that past actions on the part of the
employer (or agent or attorney) may have had and may continue to have a chilling or otherwise negative effect on
the recruitment, employment, and retention of U.S. workers, the OFLC Administrator may require the employer to
conform to special procedures before and after the temporary labor certification determination. These special
procedures may include special on-site positive recruitment and streamlined interviewing and referral techniques.
The special procedures are designed to enhance U.S. worker recruitment and retention in the next year as a condition
for receiving a temporary agricultural labor certification. Such requirements will be reasonable; will not require the
employer to offer better wages, working conditions, and benefits than those specified in §655.122; and will be no
more than deemed necessary to assure employer compliance with the test of U.S. worker availability and adverse
effect criteria of this subpart.
(b) Notification of required special procedures. The OFLC Administrator will notify the employer (or agent or
attorney) in writing of the special procedures that will be required in the coming year. The notification will state the
reasons for the imposition of the requirements, state that the employer's agreement to accept the conditions will
constitute inclusion of them as bona fide conditions and terms of a temporary agricultural labor certification, and
will offer the employer an opportunity to request an administrative review or a de novo hearing before an ALJ. If an
administrative review or de novo hearing is requested, the procedures prescribed in §655.171 will apply.
(c) Failure to comply with special procedures. If the OFLC Administrator determines that the employer has
failed to comply with special procedures required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OFLC Administrator
will send a written notice to the employer, stating that the employer's otherwise affirmative H-2A certification
determination will be reduced by 25 percent of the total number of H-2A workers requested (which cannot be more
than those requested in the previous year) for a period of 1 year. Notice of such a reduction in the number of workers
requested will be conveyed to the employer by the OFLC Administrator in the OFLC Administrator's written
certification determination. The notice will offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review or a
de novo hearing before an ALJ. If administrative review or a de novo hearing is requested, the procedures prescribed
in §655.171 will apply, provided that if the ALJ affirms the OFLC Administrator's determination that the employer
has failed to comply with special procedures required by paragraph (a) of this section, the reduction in the number of
workers requested will be 25 percent of the total number of H-2A workers requested (which cannot be more than
those requested in the previous year) for a period of 1 year.
§655.184 Applications involving fraud or willful misrepresentation.
(a) Referral for investigation. If the CO discovers possible fraud or willful misrepresentation involving an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the CO may refer the matter to the DHS and the Department's
Office of the Inspector General for investigation.
(b) Sanctions. If the WHD, a court or the DHS determines that there was fraud or willful misrepresentation
involving an Application for Temporary Employment Certification and certification has been granted, a finding
under this paragraph will be cause to revoke the certification. The finding of fraud or willful misrepresentation may
also constitute a debarrable violation under §655.182.
§655.185 Job service complaint system; enforcement of work contracts.
(a) Filing with DOL. Complaints arising under this subpart must be filed through the Job Service Complaint
System, as described in 20 CFR part 658, subpart E. Complaints involving allegations of fraud or misrepresentation
must be referred by the SWA to the CO for appropriate handling and resolution. Complaints that involve worker
contracts must be referred by the SWA to the WHD for appropriate handling and resolution, as described in 29 CFR
part 501. As part of this process, the WHD may report the results of its investigation to the OFLC Administrator for
consideration of employer penalties or such other action as may be appropriate.
(b) Filing with the Department of Justice. Complaints alleging that an employer discouraged an eligible U.S.
worker from applying, failed to hire, discharged, or otherwise discriminated against an eligible U.S. worker, or

discovered violations involving the same, will be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division,
Office of Special Counsel for Unfair Immigration Related Employment Practices (OSC), in addition to any activity,
investigation, and/or enforcement action taken by ETA or a SWA. Likewise, if OSC becomes aware of a violation of
the regulations in this subpart, it may provide such information to the appropriate SWA and the CO.

Subparts C-E [Reserved]
Subpart F—Attestations by Employers Using Alien Crewmembers for
Longshore Activities in U.S. Ports
SOURCE: 60 FR 3956, 3976, Jan. 19, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§655.500 Purpose, procedure and applicability of subparts F and G of this part.
(a) Purpose. (1) Section 258 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”) prohibits nonimmigrant alien
crewmembers admitted to the United States on D-visas from performing longshore work at U.S. ports except in five
specific instances:
(i) Where the vessel's country of registration does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers from performing longshore
work in that country's ports and nationals of a country (or countries) which does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers
from performing longshore work in that country's ports hold a majority of the ownership interest in the vessel, as
determined by the Secretary of State (henceforth referred to as the “reciprocity exception”);
(ii) Where there is in effect in a local port one or more collective bargaining agreement(s), each covering at
least thirty percent of the longshore workers, and each permitting the activity to be performed under the terms of
such agreement(s);
(iii) Where there is no collective bargaining agreement covering at least thirty percent of the longshore
workers at the particular port and an attestation with accompanying documentation has been filed with the
Department of Labor attesting that, among other things, the use of alien crewmembers to perform a particular
activity of longshore work is permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular port (henceforth referred to as
the “prevailing practice exception”);
(iv) Where the longshore work is to be performed at a particular location in the State of Alaska and an
attestation with accompanying documentation has been filed with the Department of Labor attesting that, among
other things, before using alien crewmembers to perform the activity specified in the attestation, the employer will
make a bona fide request for and employ United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in
sufficient numbers from contract stevedoring companies, labor organizations recognized as exclusive bargaining
representatives of United States longshore workers, and private dock operators (henceforth referred to as the
“Alaska exception”); or
(v) Where the longshore work involves an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system
on a vessel and the Administrator has not previously determined that an attestation must be filed pursuant to this part
as a basis for performing those functions (henceforth referred to as the “automated vessel exception”).
(2) The term “longshore work” does not include the loading or unloading of hazardous cargo, as determined
by the Secretary of Transportation, for safety and environmental protection. The Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) through the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), determines whether an employer
may use alien crewmembers for longshore work at U.S. ports. In those cases where an employer must file an
attestation in order to perform such work, the Department of Labor shall be responsible for accepting the filing of
such attestations. Subpart F of this part sets forth the procedure for filing attestations with the Department of Labor

for employers proposing to use alien crewmembers for longshore work at U.S. ports under the prevailing practice
exception, the Alaska exception, and where it has been determined that an attestation is required under the
automated vessel exception listed in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. Subpart G of this part sets forth complaint,
investigation, and penalty provisions with respect to such attestations.
(b) Procedure. (1) Under the prevailing practice exception in sec. 258(c) of the Act, and in those cases where
it has been determined that an attestation is required under the automated vessel exception for longshore work to be
performed at locations other than in the State of Alaska, the procedure involves filing an attestation with the
Department of Labor attesting that:
(i) The use of alien crewmembers for a particular activity of longshore work is the prevailing practice at the
particular port;
(ii) The use of alien crewmembers is not during a strike or lockout nor designed to influence the election of a
collective bargaining representative; and
(iii) Notice of the attestation has been provided to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the
local port, or, where there is none, notice has been provided to longshore workers employed at the local port.
(2) Under the automated vessel exception in sec. 258(c) of the Act, no attestation is required in cases where
longshore activity consists of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a
vessel. The legislation creates a rebuttable presumption that the use of alien crewmembers for the operation of such
automated systems is the prevailing practice. In order to overcome such presumption, it must be shown by the
preponderance of the evidence submitted by any interested party, that the use of alien crewmembers for such activity
is not the prevailing practice at the particular port, that it is during a strike or lockout, or that it is intended or
designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port.
(3) Under the Alaska exception in sec. 258(d) of the Act, and in those cases where it has been determined that
an attestation is required under the automated vessel exception consisting of the use of such equipment for longshore
work to be performed in the State of Alaska, the procedure involves filing an attestation with the Department of
Labor attesting that:
(i) The employer will make a bona fide request for United States longshore workers who are qualified and
available in sufficient numbers to perform the activity at the particular time and location from the parties to whom
notice has been provided under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) (B) and (C) of this section, except that:
(A) Wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies which meet the requirements of section 32 of the
Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 932) have signed a joint collective bargaining
agreement with a single labor organization recognized as an exclusive bargaining representative of United States
longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.), the employer
may request longshore workers from only one such contract stevedoring company, and
(B) A request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock may be made only for longshore work to
be performed at that dock and only if the operator meets the requirements of section 32 of the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 932);
(ii) The employer will employ all United States longshore workers made available in response to the request
made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers and who
are needed to perform the longshore activity at the particular time and location attested to;
(iii) The use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not intended or designed to influence and election of a
bargaining representative for workers in the State of Alaska; and

(iv) Notice of the attestation has been provided to:
(A) Labor organizations which have been recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States
longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.) and which make
available or intend to make available workers to the particular location where the longshore work is to be performed;
(B) Contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at
that location; and
(C) Operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.
(c) Applicability. Subparts F and G of this part apply to all employers who seek to employ alien crewmembers
for longshore work at U.S. ports under the prevailing practice exception, to all employers who seek to employ alien
crewmembers for longshore work at locations in the State of Alaska under the Alaska exception, to all employers
claiming the automated vessel exception, and to those cases where it has been determined that an attestation is
required under the automated vessel exception.
[60 FR 3956, 3976, Jan. 19, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 35520, June 21, 2006]

§655.501 Overview of responsibilities.
This section provides a context for the attestation process, to facilitate understanding by employers that may
seek to employ alien crewmembers for longshore work under the prevailing practice exception, under the Alaska
exception, and in those cases where an attestation is necessary under the automated vessel exception.
(a) Department of Labor's responsibilities. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) administers the
attestation process. Within DOL, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) shall have responsibility for
setting up and operating the attestation process; the Employment Standards Administration's Wage and Hour
Division shall be responsible for investigating and resolving any complaints filed concerning such attestations.
(b) Employer attestation responsibilities. (1) Each employer seeking to use alien crewmembers for longshore
work at a local U.S. port pursuant to the prevailing practice exception or where an attestation is required under the
automated vessel exception for longshore work to be performed at locations other than in the State of Alaska shall,
as the first step, submit an attestation on Form ETA 9033, as described in §655.510 of this part, to ETA at the
address set forth at §655.510(b) of this part. If ETA accepts the attestation for filing, pursuant to §655.510 of this
part, ETA shall return the cover form of the accepted attestation to the employer, and, at the same time, shall provide
notice of the filing to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) office having jurisdiction over the port where longshore work will be performed.
(2) Each employer seeking to use alien crewmembers for longshore work at a particular location in the State of
Alaska pursuant to the Alaska exception or where an attestation is required under the automated vessel exception for
longshore work to be performed at a particular location in Alaska shall submit, as a first step, an attestation on Form
ETA 9033-A, as described in §655.533 of this part, to ETA at the address of the Seattle regional office as set forth at
§655.532 of this part. The address appears in the instructions to Form ETA 9033-A. ETA shall return the cover form
of the accepted attestation to the employer, and, at the same time, shall provide notice of the filing to the DHS office
having jurisdiction over the location where longshore work will be performed.
(c) Complaints. Complaints concerning misrepresentation in the attestation, failure of the employer to carry
out the terms of the attestation, or complaints that an employer is required to file an attestation under the automated
vessel exception, may be filed with the Wage and Hour Division, according to the procedures set forth in subpart G
of this part. Complaints of “misrepresentation” may include assertions that an employer has attested to the use of
alien crewmembers only for a particular activity of longshore work and has thereafter used such alien crewmembers
for another activity of longshore work. If the Division determines that the complaint presents reasonable cause to
warrant an investigation, the Division shall then investigate, and, where appropriate, after an opportunity for a

hearing, assess sanctions and penalties. Subpart G of this part further provides that interested parties may obtain an
administrative law judge hearing on the Division's determination after an investigation and may seek the Secretary's
review of the administrative law judge's decision. Subpart G of this part also provides that a complainant may
request that the Wage and Hour Administrator issue a cease and desist order in the case of either alleged violation(s)
of an attestation or longshore work by alien crewmember(s) employed by an employer allegedly not qualified for the
claimed automated vessel exception. Upon the receipt of such a request, the Division shall notify the employer,
provide an opportunity for a response and an informal meeting, and then rule on the request, which shall be granted
if the preponderance of the evidence submitted supports the complainant's position.

and evidence prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. This §655.510 shall not apply in the case of
longshore work performed at a particular location in the State of Alaska. The procedures governing the filing of
attestations under the Alaska exception are set forth at §§655.530 through 655.541.
(b) Where and when should attestations be submitted? (1) Attestations must be submitted, by U.S. mail,
private carrier, or facsimile transmission to the U.S. Department of Labor office(s) which are designated by the
OFLC Administrator. Attestations must be received and date-stamped by DOL at least 14 calendar days prior to the
date of the first performance of the intended longshore activity, and shall be accepted for filing or returned by ETA
in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section within 14 calendar days of the date received by ETA. An attestation
which is accepted by ETA solely because it was not reviewed within 14 days is subject to subsequent invalidation
pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section. Every employer filing an attestation shall have an agent or representative
with a United States address. Such address shall be clearly indicated on the Form ETA 9033. In order to ensure that
an attestation has been accepted for filing prior to the date of the performance of the longshore activity, employers
are advised to take mailing time into account to make sure that ETA receives the attestation at least 14 days prior to
the first performance of the longshore activity.

(2) Unanticipated Emergencies. ETA may accept for filing attestations received after the 14-day deadline
when due to an unanticipated emergency, as defined in §655.502 of this part. When an employer is claiming an
unanticipated emergency, it shall submit documentation to support such a claim. ETA shall then make a
determination on the validity of the claim, and shall accept the attestation for filing or return it in accordance with
paragraph (g) of this section. ETA shall in no case accept an attestation received later than the date of the first
performance of the activity.
(c) What should be submitted?—(1) Form ETA 9033 with accompanying documentation. For each port, a
completed and dated original Form ETA 9033, or facsimile transmission thereof, containing the required attestation
elements and the original signature of the employer (or the employer's designated agent or representative) shall be
submitted, along with two copies of the completed, signed, and dated Form ETA 9033. (If the attestation is
submitted by facsimile transmission, the attestation containing the original signature shall be maintained at the U.S.
business address of the employer's designated agent or representative). Copies of Form ETA 9033 are available at
the National Processing Centers and at the National Office. In addition, the employer shall submit two sets of all
facts and evidence to show compliance with each of the attestation elements as prescribed by the regulatory
standards in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. In the case of an investigation pursuant to subpart G of this
part, the employer shall have the burden of proof to establish the validity of each attestation. The employer shall
maintain in its records at the office of its U.S. agent, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of filing, sufficient
documentation to meet its burden of proof, which shall at a minimum include the documentation described in this
§655.510, and shall make the documents available to Department of Labor officials upon request.
Whenever any document is submitted to a Federal agency or retained in the employer's records pursuant to
this part, the document either shall be in the English language or shall be accompanied by a written translation into
the English language certified by the translator as to the accuracy of the translation and his/her competency to
translate.
(2) Statutory precondition regarding collective bargaining agreements. (i) The employer may file an
attestation only when there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the port covering 30 percent or more of
the longshore workers in the port. The employer shall attest on the Form ETA 9033 that no such collective
bargaining agreement exists at the port at the time that the attestation is filed.
(ii) The employer is not required to submit with the Form ETA 9033 documentation substantiating that there is
no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the port covering 30 percent or more of the longshore workers. If a
complaint is filed which presents reasonable cause to believe that such an agreement exists, the Department shall
conduct an investigation. In such an investigation, the employer shall have the burden of proving that no such
collective bargaining agreement exists.
(3) Ports for which attestations may be filed. Employers may file an attestation for a port which is listed in
appendix A (U.S. Seaports) to this subpart. Employers may also file an attestation for a particular location not in
appendix A to this subpart if additional facts and evidence are submitted with the attestation to demonstrate that the
location is a port, meeting all of the criteria as defined by §655.502 of this part.
(4) Attestation elements. The attestation elements referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are mandated
by sec. 258(c)(1)(B) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1288(c)(1)(B)). Section 258(c)(1)(B) of the Act requires employers who
seek to have alien crewmembers engage in a longshore activity to attest as follows:
(i) The performance of the activity by alien crewmembers is permitted under the prevailing practice of the
particular port as of the date of filing of the attestation;
(ii) The use of the alien crewmembers for such activity is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute, and is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the
local port; and

(iii) Notice of the attestation has been provided by the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer
to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local port, or, where there is no such bargaining
representative, notice has been provided to longshore workers employed at the local port.
(d) The first attestation element: prevailing practice. For an employer to be in compliance with the first
attestation element, it is required to have been the prevailing practice during the 12-month period preceding the
filing of the attestation, for a particular activity of longshore work at the particular port to be performed by alien
crewmembers. For each port, a prevailing practice can exist for any of four different types of longshore work:
loading of cargo, unloading of cargo, operation of cargo-related equipment, or handling of mooring lines. It is thus
possible that at a particular port it is the prevailing practice for alien crewmembers to unload vessels but not the
prevailing practice to load them. An employer shall indicate on the attestation form which of the four longshore
activities it is claiming is the prevailing practice for such work to be performed by alien crewmembers.
(1) Establishing a prevailing practice. (i) In establishing that a particular activity of longshore work is the
prevailing practice at a particular port, an employer shall submit facts and evidence to show that in the 12-month
period preceding the filing of the attestation, one of the following conditions existed:
(A) Over fifty percent of vessels docking at the port used alien crewmembers for the activity; or
(B) Alien crewmembers made up over fifty percent of the workers in the port who engaged in the activity.
(ii) Prevailing practice after Secretary of State determination of non-reciprocity. Section 258(d) of the Act
provides a reciprocity exception (separate from the prevailing practice exception) to the prohibition on performance
of longshore work by alien crewmembers in U.S. ports. However, this reciprocity exception becomes nonapplicable
where the Secretary of State determines that, for a particular activity of longshore work, a particular country (by law,
regulation, or practice) prohibits such activity by U.S. crewmembers in its ports. When the Secretary of State places
a country on the non-reciprocity list (which means, for the purposes of this section, Prohibitions on longshore work
by U.S. nationals; listing by country at 22 CFR 89.1), crewmembers on vessels from that country (that is, vessels
that are registered in that country or vessels whose majority ownership interest is held by nationals of that country)
are not permitted to perform longshore work in U.S. waters, absent applicability of some exception other than the
reciprocity exception. The Secretary of State's determination has the following effects in the establishment of a
prevailing practice for a particular longshore activity at a particular U.S. port for purposes of the prevailing practice
exception.
(A) An employer from any country, other than the country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list, may
include the longshore activities performed by alien crewmembers on all vessels in establishing the prevailing
practice for a particular longshore activity in a particular port.
(B) An employer from a country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list may file an attestation for the
prevailing practice exception under the standards and requirements established in this subpart F (except as provided
in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section), provided that the attestation is filed at least 12 months after the date on
which the employer's country is placed on the list.
(C) An employer from a country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list may file an attestation pursuant to
the prevailing practice exception earlier than 12 months from the date on which the employer's country is placed on
the list, except that the following restrictions shall apply to such attestation:
(1) The employer shall submit facts and evidence to show that, for the 12-month period preceding the date of
the attestation, the use of alien crewmembers to perform a particular activity of longshore work was permitted by the
prevailing practice in the port (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) without considering or including
such activity by crewmembers on vessels from the employer's country; or
(2) The employer shall submit facts and evidence (including data on activities performed by crewmembers on
vessels from the employer's country) to show that the use of alien crewmembers to perform a particular activity of

longshore work was permitted by the prevailing practice in the port (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section)
for one of two periods—
(i) For the employer whose country has not previously been on the non-reciprocity list, the period is the
continuous 12-month period prior to May 28, 1991 (the effective date of section 258 of the Act); or
(ii) For the employer whose country was at some time on the non-reciprocity list, but was subsequently
removed from the non-reciprocity list and then restored to the non-reciprocity list (on one or more occasions), the
period is the last continuous 12-month period during which the employer's country was not under the reciprocity
exception (that is, was listed on the non-reciprocity list).
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1):
(A) “Workers in the port engaged in the activity” means any person who performed the activity in any
calendar day;
(B) Vessels shall be counted each time they dock at the particular port):
(C) Vessels exempt from section 258 of the INA for safety and environmental protection shall not be included
in counting the number of vessels which dock at the port (see Department of Transportation Regulations); and
(D) Automated vessels shall not be included in counting the number of vessels which dock at the port. For
establishing a prevailing practice under the automated vessel exception see §655.520 of this part.
(2) Documentation. In assembling the facts and evidence required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the
employer may consult with the port authority which has jurisdiction over the local port, the collective bargaining
representative(s) of longshore workers at the local port, other employers, or any other entity which is familiar with
the practices at the port. Such documentation shall include a written summary of a survey of the experience of
shipmasters who entered the local port in the previous year; or a letter, affidavit, or other written statement from an
appropriate local port authority regarding the use of alien crewmembers to perform the longshore activity at the port
in the previous year; or other documentation of comparable weight. Written statements from collective bargaining
representatives and/or shipping agents with direct knowledge of practices regarding the use of alien crewmembers in
the local port may also be pertinent. Such documentation shall accompany the Form ETA 9033, and any underlying
documentation which supports the employer's burden of proof shall be maintained in the employer's records at the
office of the U.S. agent as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(e) The second attestation element: no strike or lockout; no intention or design to influence bargaining
representative election. (1) The employer shall attest that, at the time of submitting the attestation, there is not a
strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute covering the employer's activity, and that it will not use alien
crewmembers during a strike or lockout after filing the attestation. The employer shall also attest that the
employment of such aliens is not intended or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for
workers in the local port. Labor disputes for purposes of this attestation element relate only to those involving
longshore workers at the port of intended employment. This attestation element applies to strikes and lockouts and
elections of bargaining representatives at the local port where the use of alien crewmembers for longshore work is
intended.
(2) Documentation. As documentation to substantiate the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an
employer may submit a statement of the good faith efforts made to determine whether there is a strike or lockout at
the particular port, as, for example, by contacting the port authority or the collective bargaining representative for
longshore workers at the particular port.
(f) The third attestation element: notice of filing. The employer of alien crewmembers shall attest that at the
time of filing the attestation, notice of filing has been provided to the bargaining representative of the longshore

workers in the local port, or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been provided
to longshore workers employed at the local port through posting in conspicuous locations and through other
appropriate means.
(1) Notification of bargaining representative. No later than the date the attestation is received by DOL to be
considered for filing, the employer of alien crewmembers shall notify the bargaining representative (if any) of
longshore workers at the local port that the attestation is being submitted to DOL. The notice shall include a copy of
the Form ETA 9033, shall state the activity(ies) for which the attestation is submitted, and shall state in that notice
that the attestation and accompanying documentation are available at the national office of ETA for review by
interested parties. The employer may have its owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer provide such
notice. Notices under this paragraph (f)(1) shall include the following statement: “Complaints alleging
misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation and/or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation may be
filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.”
(2) Posting notice where there is no bargaining representative. If there is no bargaining representative of
longshore workers at the local port when the employer submits an attestation to ETA, the employer shall provide
written notice to the port authority for distribution to the public on request. In addition, the employer shall post one
or more written notices at the local port, stating that the attestation with accompanying documentation has been
submitted, the activity(ies) for which the attestation has been submitted, and that the attestation and accompanying
documentation are available at the national office of ETA for review by interested parties. Such posted notice shall
be clearly visible and unobstructed, and shall be posted in conspicuous places where the longshore workers readily
can read the posted notice on the way to or from their duties. Appropriate locations for posting such notices include
locations in the immediate proximity of mandatory Fair Labor Standards Act wage and hour notices and
Occupational Safety and Health Act occupational safety and health notices. The notice shall include a copy of the
Form ETA 9033 filed with DOL, shall provide information concerning the availability of supporting documents for
examination at the national office of ETA, and shall include the following statement: “Complaints alleging
misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation and/or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation may be
filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.”
(3) Documentation. The employer shall provide a statement setting forth the name and address of the person to
whom the notice was provided and where and when the notice was posted and shall attach a copy of the notice.
(g) Actions on attestations submitted for filing. Once an attestation has been received from an employer, a
determination shall be made by the Certifying Officer whether to accept the attestation for filing or return it. The
Certifying Officer may request additional explanation and/or documentation from the employer in making this
determination. An attestation which is properly filled out and which includes accompanying documentation for each
of the requirements set forth at §655.510(d) through (f) shall be accepted for filing by ETA on the date it is signed
by the Certifying Officer unless it falls within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Once
an attestation is accepted for filing, ETA shall then follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this
section. Upon acceptance of the employer's attestation by ETA, the attestation and accompanying documentation
will be forwarded and shall be available in a timely manner for public examination at the ETA national office. ETA
shall not consider information contesting an attestation received by ETA prior to the determination to accept or
return the attestation for filing. Such information shall not be made part of ETA's administrative record on the
attestation, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a complaint pursuant to subpart G of this part if the
attestation is accepted by ETA for filing.
(1) Acceptance. (i) If the attestation is properly filled out and includes accompanying documentation for each
of the requirements at §655.510(d) through (f), and does not fall within one of the categories set forth at paragraph
(g)(2) of this section, ETA shall accept the attestation for filing, provide notification to the DHS office having
jurisdiction over the port where longshore work will be performed, and return to the employer, or the employer's
agent or representative at a U.S. address, one copy of the attestation form submitted by the employer, with ETA's
acceptance indicated thereon. The employer may then use alien crewmembers for the particular activity of longshore
work at the U.S. port cited in the attestation in accordance with DHS regulations.
(ii) DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or adequacy of an attestation accepted for filing.

(2) Unacceptable attestations. ETA shall not accept an attestation for filing and shall return such attestation to
the employer, or the employer's agent or representative at a U.S. address, when one of the following conditions
exists:
(i) When the Form ETA 9033 is not properly filled out. Examples of improperly filled out Form ETA 9033's
include instances where the employer has neglected to check all the necessary boxes, or where the employer has
failed to include the name of the port where it intends to use the alien crewmembers for longshore work, or where
the employer has named a port that is not listed in appendix A and has failed to submit facts and evidence to support
a showing that the location is a port as defined by §655.502, or when the employer has failed to sign the attestation
or to designate an agent in the United States;
(ii) When the Form ETA 9033 with accompanying documentation is not received by ETA at least 14 days
prior to the date of performance of the first activity indicated on the Form ETA 9033; unless the employer is
claiming an unanticipated emergency, has included documentation which supports such claim, and ETA has found
the claim to be valid;
(iii) When the Form ETA 9033 does not include accompanying documentation for each of the requirements
set forth at §655.510 (d) through (f);
(iv) When the accompanying documentation required by paragraph (c) of this section submitted by the
employer, on its face, is inconsistent with the requirements set forth at §655.510 (d) through (f). Examples of such a
situation include instances where the Form ETA 9033 pertains to one port and the accompanying documentation to
another; where the Form ETA 9033 pertains to one activity of longshore work and the accompanying documentation
obviously refers to another; or where the documentation clearly indicates that only thirty percent, instead of the
required fifty percent, of the activity attested to is performed by alien crewmembers;
(v) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, after an investigation
pursuant to subpart G of this part, that the particular activity of longshore work which the employer has attested is
the prevailing practice at a particular port, is not, in fact, the prevailing practice at the particular port;
(vi) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, that a cease and desist
order has been issued pursuant to subpart G of this part, with respect to the attesting employer's performance of the
particular activity and port, in violation of a previously accepted attestation;
(vii) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, after an investigation
pursuant to subpart G of this part, that the particular employer has misrepresented or failed to comply with an
attestation previously submitted and accepted for filing, but in no case for a period of more than one year after the
date of the Administrator's notice and provided that DHS has not advised ETA that the prohibition is in effect for a
lesser period; or
(viii) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, that the employer has
failed to comply with any penalty, sanction, or other remedy assessed in a final agency action following an
investigation by the Wage and Hour Division pursuant to subpart G of this part.
(3) Resubmission. If the attestation is not accepted for filing pursuant to the categories set forth in paragraph
(g)(2) of this section, ETA shall return to the employer, or the employer's agent or representative, at a U.S. address,
the attestation form and accompanying documentation submitted by the employer. ETA shall notify the employer, in
writing, of the reason(s) that the attestation is unacceptable. When an attestation is found to be unacceptable
pursuant to paragraphs (g)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the employer may resubmit the attestation with the
proper documentation. When an attestation is found to be unacceptable pursuant to paragraphs (g)(2) (v) through
(viii) of this section and returned, such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary of Labor.
(h) Effective date and validity of filed attestations. An attestation is filed and effective as of the date it is
accepted and signed by the Certifying Officer. Such attestation is valid for the 12-month period beginning on the

date of acceptance for filing, unless suspended or invalidated pursuant to subpart G of this part or paragraph (i) of
this section. The filed attestation expires at the end of the 12-month period of validity.
(i) Suspension or invalidation of filed attestations. Suspension or invalidation of an attestation may result from
enforcement action(s) under subpart G of this part (i.e., investigation(s) conducted by the Administrator or cease and
desist order(s) issued by the Administrator regarding the employer's misrepresentation in or failure to carry out its
attestation); or from a discovery by ETA that it made an error in accepting the attestation because such attestation
falls within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(1) Result of Wage and Hour Division action. Upon the determination of a violation under subpart G of this
part, the Administrator shall, pursuant to §655.660(b), notify the DHS of the violation and of the Administrator's
notice to ETA.
(2) Result of ETA action. If, after accepting an attestation for filing, ETA finds that the attestation is
unacceptable because it falls within one of the categories set forth at paragraph (g)(2) of this section, and as a result,
ETA suspends or invalidates the attestation, ETA shall notify the DHS of such suspension or invalidation and shall
return a copy of the attestation form to the employer, or the employer's agent or representative, at a U.S. address.
ETA shall notify the employer, in writing, of the reason(s) that the attestation is suspended or invalidated. When an
attestation is found to be suspended or invalidated pursuant to paragraphs (g)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the
employer may resubmit the attestation with the proper documentation. When an attestation is suspended or
invalidated because it falls within one of the categories in paragraphs (g)(2) (v) through (viii) of this section, such
action shall be the final decision of the Secretary of Labor, except as set forth in subpart G of this part.
(j) Withdrawal of accepted attestations. (1) An employer who has submitted an attestation which has been
accepted for filing may withdraw such attestation at any time before the 12-month period of its validity terminates,
unless the Administrator has found reasonable cause under subpart G to commence an investigation of the particular
attestation. Such withdrawal may be advisable, for example, when the employer learns that the particular
activity(ies) of longshore work which it has attested is the prevailing practice to perform with alien crewmembers
may not, in fact, have been the prevailing practice at the particular port at the time of filing. Requests for such
withdrawals shall be in writing and shall be directed to the Certifying Officer.
(2) Withdrawal of an attestation shall not affect an employer's liability with respect to any failure to meet the
conditions attested to which took place before the withdrawal, or for misrepresentations in an attestation. However,
if an employer has not yet performed the particular longshore activity(ies) at the port in question, the Administrator
will not find reasonable cause to investigate unless it is alleged, and there is reasonable cause to believe, that the
employer has made misrepresentations in the attestation or documentation thereof, or that the employer has not in
fact given the notice attested to.

§655.520 Special provisions regarding automated vessels.
In general, an attestation is not required in the case of a particular activity of longshore work consisting of the
use of automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated systems on a vessel. The legislation creates a
rebuttable presumption that the use of alien crewmembers for the operation of such automated systems is the
prevailing practice. In order to overcome such presumption, it must be shown by the preponderance of the evidence
submitted by any interested party, that the use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not the prevailing practice.
Longshore work involving the use of such equipment shall be exempt from the attestation requirement only if the
activity consists of using that equipment. If the automated equipment is not used in the particular activity of
longshore work, an attestation is required as described under §655.510 of this part if it is the prevailing practice in
the port to use alien crewmembers for this work, except that in all cases, where an attestation is required for
longshore work to be performed at a particular location in the State of Alaska, an employer shall file such attestation

under the Alaska exception pursuant to §§655.530 through 655.541 on Form ETA 9033-A. When automated
equipment is used in the particular activity of longshore work, an attestation is required only if the Administrator
finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that the
performance of the particular activity of longshore work is not the prevailing practice at the port, or was during a
strike or lockout or intended to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port, or if
the Administrator issues a cease and desist order against use of the automated equipment without such attestation.
(a) Procedure when attestation is required. If it is determined pursuant to subpart G of this part that an
attestation is required for longshore work consisting of the use of automated equipment at a location other than in
the State of Alaska, the employer shall comply with all the requirements set forth at §655.510 of this part except
paragraph (d) of §655.510. In lieu of complying with §655.510(d) of this part, the employer shall comply with
paragraph (b) of this section. If it is determined pursuant to subpart G of this part that an attestation is required for
longshore work consisting of the use of automated equipment at a particular location in the State of Alaska, the
employer shall comply with all the requirements set forth at §§655.530 through 655.541 of this part.
(b) The first attestation element: prevailing practice for automated vessels. For an employer to be in
compliance with the first attestation element, it is required to have been the prevailing practice that over fifty percent
(as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of a particular activity of longshore work which was performed
through the use of automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated equipment at the particular port
during the 12-month period preceding the filing of the attestation, was performed by alien crewmembers. For
purposes of this paragraph (b), only automated vessels shall be included in counting the number of vessels which
dock at the port.
(1) Establishing a prevailing practice. (i) In establishing that the use of alien crewmembers to perform a
particular activity of longshore work consisting of the use of self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated
systems on a vessel is the prevailing practice at a particular port, an employer shall submit facts and evidence to
show that in the 12-month period preceding the filing of the attestation, one of the following conditions existed:
(A) Over fifty percent of the automated vessels docking at the port used alien crewmembers for the activity
(for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a vessel shall be counted each time it docks at the particular port); or
(B) Alien crewmembers made up over fifty percent of the workers who performed the activity with respect to
such automated vessels.
(ii) Prevailing practice after Secretary of State determination of non-reciprocity. Section 258(d) of the Act
provides a reciprocity exception (separate from the prevailing practice exception) to the prohibition on performance
of longshore work by alien crewmembers in U.S. ports. However, this reciprocity exception becomes nonapplicable
where the Secretary of State determines that, for a particular activity of longshore work, a particular country (by law,
regulation, or practice) prohibits such activity by U.S. crewmembers in its ports. When the Secretary of State places
a country on the non-reciprocity list (which means, for the purposes of this section, Prohibitions on longshore work
by U.S. nationals; listing by country at 22 CFR 89.1), crewmembers on vessels from that country (that is, vessels
that are registered in that country or vessels whose majority ownership interest is held by nationals of that country)
are not permitted to perform longshore work in U.S. waters, absent applicability of some exception other than the
reciprocity exception. The Secretary of State's determination has the following effects in the establishment of a
prevailing practice for a particular longshore activity at a particular U.S. port for purposes of the prevailing practice
exception.
(A) An employer from any country, other than the country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list, may
include the longshore activities performed by alien crewmembers on all vessels in establishing the prevailing
practice for a particular longshore activity in a particular port.
(B) An employer from a country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list may file an attestation for the
prevailing practice exception under the standards and requirements established in this subpart F (except as provided

in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section), provided that the attestation is filed at least 12 months after the date on
which the employer's country is placed on the list.
(C) An employer from a country which is placed on the non-reciprocity list may file an attestation pursuant to
the prevailing practice exception earlier than 12 months from the date on which the employer's country is placed on
the list, except that the following restrictions shall apply to such attestation:
(1) The employer shall submit facts and evidence to show that, for the 12-month period preceding the date of
the attestation, the use of alien crewmembers to perform a particular activity of longshore work was permitted by the
prevailing practice in the port (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) without considering or including
such activity by crewmembers on vessels from the employer's country; or
(2) The employer shall submit facts and evidence (including data on activities performed by crewmembers on
vessels from the employer's country) to show that the use of alien crewmembers to perform a particular activity of
longshore work was permitted by the prevailing practice in the port (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section)
for one of two periods—
(i) For the employer whose country has not previously been on the non-reciprocity list, the period is the
continuous 12-month period prior to May 28, 1991 (the effective date of section 258 of the Act); or
(ii) For the employer whose country was at some time on the non-reciprocity list, but was subsequently
removed from the non-reciprocity list and then restored to the non-reciprocity list (on one or more occasions), the
period is the last continuous 12-month period during which the employer's country was not under the reciprocity
exception (that is, was listed on the non-reciprocity list).
(2) Documentation. In assembling the documentation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the
employer may consult with the port authority which has jurisdiction over the local port, the collective bargaining
representative(s) of longshore workers at the local port, other employers, or any other entity which is familiar with
the practices at the port. The documentation shall include a written summary of a survey of the experience of
shipmasters who entered the local port in the previous year; or a letter, affidavit, or other written statement from an
appropriate local port authority regarding the use of alien crewmembers to perform the longshore activity at the port
in the previous year; or other documentation of comparable weight. Written statements from collective bargaining
representatives and/or shipping agents with direct knowledge of practices regarding the use of alien crewmembers
may also be pertinent. Such documentation shall accompany the Form ETA 9033, and any underlying
documentation which supports the employer's burden of proof shall be maintained in the employer's records at the
office of the U.S. agent as required under §655.510(c)(1) of this part.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control No. 1205-0309)

ALASKA EXCEPTION
§655.530 Special provisions regarding the performance of longshore activities at locations in the State of
Alaska.
Applicability. Section §655.510 of this part shall not apply to longshore work performed at locations in the
State of Alaska. The performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers at locations in the State of Alaska shall
instead be governed by §§655.530 through 655.541. The use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore work in
Alaska consisting of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel
shall continue to be governed by the provisions of §655.520 of this part, except that, if the Administrator finds,
based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that an attestation is
required because the performance of the particular activity of longshore work is not the prevailing practice at the
location in the State of Alaska, or was during a strike or lockout or intended to influence an election of a bargaining
representative for workers at that location, or if the Administrator issues a cease and desist order against use of the

automated equipment without such an attestation, the required attestation shall be filed pursuant to the Alaska
exception at §§655.530 through 655.541 and not the prevailing practice exception at §655.510.
§655.531 Who may submit attestations for locations in Alaska?
In order to use alien crewmembers to perform longshore activities at a particular location in the State of
Alaska an employer shall submit an attestation on Form ETA 9033-A. As noted at §655.502, “Definitions,” for
purposes of §§655.530 through 655.541, which govern the performance of longshore activities by alien
crewmembers under the Alaska exception, “employer” includes any agent or representative designated by the
employer. An employer may file a single attestation for multiple locations in the State of Alaska.
§655.532 Where and when should attestations be submitted for locations in Alaska?
(a) Attestations shall be submitted, by U.S. mail, private carrier, or facsimile transmission to the U.S.
Department of Labor regional office of the Employment and Training Administration in Seattle, Washington.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, attestations shall be received and date-stamped by the
Department at least 30 calendar days prior to the date of the first performance of the longshore activity. The
attestation shall be accepted for filing or returned by ETA in accordance with §655.538 within 14 calendar days of
the date received by ETA. An attestation which is accepted by ETA solely because it was not reviewed within 14
days is subject to subsequent invalidation pursuant to §655.540 of this part. An employer filing an attestation shall
have an agent or representative with a United States address. Such address shall be clearly indicated on the Form
ETA 9033-A. In order to ensure that an attestation has been accepted for filing prior to the date of the first
performance of the longshore activity, employers are advised to take mailing time into account to make sure that
ETA receives the attestation at least 30 days prior to the first performance of the longshore activity.
(b) Late filings. ETA may accept for filing attestations received after the 30-day deadline where the employer
could not have reasonably anticipated the need to file an attestation for the particular location at that time. When an
employer states that it could not have reasonably anticipated the need to file the attestation at that time, it shall
submit documentation to ETA to support such a claim. ETA shall then make a determination on the validity of the
claim and shall accept the attestation for filing or return it in accordance with §655.538 of this part. ETA in no case
shall accept an attestation received less than 24 hours prior to the first performance of the activity.
§655.533 What should be submitted for locations in Alaska?
(a) Form ETA 9033-A with accompanying documentation. A completed and dated original Form ETA 9033-A,
or facsimile transmission thereof, containing the required attestation elements and the original signature of the
employer or the employer's agent or designated representative, along with two copies of the completed, signed, and
dated Form ETA 9033-A shall be submitted to ETA. (If the attestation is submitted by facsimile transmission, the
attestation containing the original signature shall be maintained at the U.S. business address of the employer's
designated agent or representative). Copies of Form ETA 9033-A are available at the National Processing Centers
and at the National office. In addition, the employer shall submit two sets of facts and evidence to show compliance
with the fourth attestation element at §655.537 of this part. In the case of an investigation pursuant to subpart G of
this part, the employer has the burden of proof to establish the validity of each attestation. The employer shall
maintain in its records at the office of its U.S. agent, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of filing, sufficient
documentation to meet its burden of proof, which shall at a minimum include the documentation described in
§§655.530 through 655.541, and shall make the documents available to Department of Labor officials upon request.
Whenever any document is submitted to a Federal agency or retained in the employer's records pursuant to this part,
the document shall either be in the English language or shall be accompanied by a written translation into the
English language certified by the translator as to the accuracy of the translation and his/her competency to translate.
(b) Attestation elements. The attestation elements referenced in §§655.534 through 655.537 of this part are
mandated by Sec. 258(d)(1) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1288(d)(1)). Section 258(d)(1) of the Act requires employers who
seek to have alien crewmembers engage in longshore activity at locations in the State of Alaska to attest as follows:

(1) The employer will make a bona fide request for United States longshore workers who are qualified and
available in sufficient numbers to perform the activity at the particular time and location from the parties to whom
notice has been provided under §655.537(a)(1) (ii) and (iii), except that:
(i) Wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have signed a joint collective bargaining agreement
with a single labor organization recognized as an exclusive bargaining representative of United States longshore
workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.), the employer may request
longshore workers from only one such contract stevedoring company, and
(ii) A request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock may be made only for longshore work to
be performed at that dock and only if the operator meets the requirements of section 32 of the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 932);
(2) The employer will employ all United States longshore workers made available in response to the request
made pursuant to §655.534(a)(1) who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers and who are needed to
perform the longshore activity at the particular time and location to which the employer has attested;
(3) The use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not intended or designed to influence an election of a
bargaining representative for workers in the State of Alaska; and
(4) Notice of the attestation has been provided to:
(i) Labor organizations which have been recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States
longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.) and which make
available or intend to make available workers to the particular location where the longshore work is to be performed;
(ii) Contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at
that location; and
(iii) Operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.
[60 FR 3956, 3976, Jan. 19, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 35520, June 21, 2006]

§655.534 The first attestation element for locations in Alaska: Bona fide request for dispatch of United
States longshore workers.
(a) The first attestation element shall be satisfied when the employer signs Form ETA 9033-A, attesting that,
before using alien crewmembers to perform longshore work during the validity period of the attestation, the
employer will make a bona fide request for United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in
sufficient numbers to perform the specified longshore activity from the parties to whom notice is provided under
§655.537(a)(1) (ii) and (iii). Although an employer is required to provide notification of filing to labor organizations
recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States longshore workers pursuant to §655.537(a)(1)(i)
of this part, an employer need not request dispatch of United States longshore workers directly from such parties.
The requests for dispatch of United States longshore workers pursuant to this section shall be directed to contract
stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at that location, and to
operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers. An employer is not required to request
dispatch of United States longshore workers from private dock operators or contract stevedoring companies which
do not meet the requirements of section 32 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C.
932) or, in the case of contract stevedoring companies, which are not licensed to do business in the State of Alaska.
(1) Wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have signed a joint collective bargaining agreement
with a single qualified labor organization, the employer may request longshore workers from only one of such
contract stevedoring companies. A qualified labor organization is one which has been recognized as an exclusive

bargaining representative of United States longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.) and which makes available or intends to make available workers to the particular
location where the longshore work is to be performed.
(2) A request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock may be made only for longshore work to
be performed at that dock.
(3) An employer shall not be required to request longshore workers from a party if that party has notified the
employer in writing that it does not intend to make available United States longshore workers who are qualified and
available in sufficient numbers to the time and location at which the longshore work is to be performed.
(4) A party that has provided such written notice to the employer under paragraph (a)(3) of this section may
subsequently notify the employer in writing that it is prepared to make available United States longshore workers
who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers to perform the longshore activity at the time and location
where the longshore work is to be performed. In that event, the employer's obligations to that party under §§655.534
and 655.535 of this part shall recommence 60 days after its receipt of such notice.
(5) When a party has provided written notice to the employer under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that it does
not intend to dispatch United States longshore workers to perform the longshore work attested to by the employer,
such notice shall expire upon the earliest of the following events:
(i) When the terms of such notice specify an expiration date at which time the employer's obligation to that
party under §§655.534 and 655.535 of this part shall recommence;
(ii) When retracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or
(iii) Upon the expiration of the validity of the attestation.
(b) Documentation. To substantiate the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, an employer shall develop
and maintain documentation to meet the employer's burden of proof under the first attestation element. The
employer shall retain records of all requests for dispatch of United States longshore workers to perform the
longshore work attested to. Such documentation shall consist of letters, telephone logs, facsimiles or other
memoranda to show that, before using alien crewmembers to perform longshore work, the employer made a bona
fide request for United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers to perform
the longshore activity. At a minimum, such documentation shall include the date the request was made, the name
and telephone number of the particular individual(s) to whom the request for dispatch was directed, and the number
and composition of full work units requested. Further, whenever any party has provided written notice to the
employer under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the employer shall retain the notice for the period of time specified
in §655.533 of this part, and, if appropriate, any subsequent notice by that party that it is prepared to make available
United States longshore workers at the times and locations attested to.
§655.535 The second attestation element for locations in Alaska: Employment of United States longshore
workers.
(a) The second attestation element shall be satisfied when the employer signs Form ETA 9033-A, attesting
that during the validity period of the attestation, the employer will employ all United States longshore workers made
available in response to the request for dispatch who, in compliance with applicable industry standards in the State
of Alaska, including safety considerations, are qualified and available in sufficient numbers and are needed to
perform the longshore activity at the particular time and location attested to.
(1) In no case shall an employer filing an attestation be required to hire less than a full work unit of United
States longshore workers needed to perform the longshore activity nor be required to provide overnight
accommodations for the longshore workers while employed. For purposes of this section, “full work unit” means the

full complement of longshore workers needed to perform the longshore activity, as determined by industry standards
in the State of Alaska, including safety considerations. Where the makeup of a full work unit is covered by one or
more collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time and location where longshore work is to be performed,
the provisions of such agreement(s) shall be deemed to be in conformance with industry standards in the State of
Alaska.
(2) In no case shall an employer be required to provide transportation to the vessel where the longshore work
is to be performed, except where:
(i) Surface transportation is available; for purposes of this section, “surface transportation” means a tugboat or
other vessel which is appropriately insured, operated by licensed personnel, and capable of safely transporting U.S.
longshore workers from shore to a vessel on which longshore work is to be performed;
(ii) Such transportation may be safely accomplished; and
(iii)(A) Travel time to the vessel does not exceed one-half hour each way; and
(B) Travel distance to the vessel from the point of embarkation does not exceed 5 miles; for purposes of this
section, “point of embarkation” means a dock or landing at which U.S. longshore workers may be safely boarded for
transport from shore to a vessel on which longshore work is to be performed; or
(C) In the cases of Wide Bay, Alaska, and Klawock/Craig, Alaska, travel time does not exceed 45 minutes
each way and travel distance to the vessel from the point of embarkation does not exceed 7.5 miles, unless the party
responding to the request for dispatch agrees to lesser time and distance specifications.
(3) If a United States longshore worker is capable of getting to and from the vessel where longshore work is to
be performed when the vessel is beyond the time and distance limitations specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this
section, and where all of the other criteria governing the employment of United States longshore workers under this
subpart are met (e.g., “qualified and available in sufficient numbers”), the employer is still obligated to employ the
worker to perform the longshore activity. In such instance, however, the employer shall not be required to provide
such transportation nor to reimburse the longshore worker for the cost incurred in transport to and from the vessel.
(4) Where an employer is required to provide transportation to the vessel because it is within the time and
distance limitations specified in (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer also shall be required to provide return
transportation to the point of embarkation.
(b) Documentation. To substantiate the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, an employer shall develop
and maintain documentation to meet the employer's burden of proof. Such documentation shall include records of
payments to contract stevedoring companies or private dock operators, payroll records for United States longshore
workers employed, or other documentation to show clearly that the employer has met its obligation to employ all
United States longshore workers made available in response to a request for dispatch who are qualified and available
in sufficient numbers. The documentation shall specify the number of full work units employed pursuant to this
section, the composition of such full work units (i.e., number of workers by job title), and the date(s) and location(s)
where the longshore work was performed. The employer also shall develop and maintain documentation concerning
the provision of transportation from the point of embarkation to the vessel on which longshore work is to be
performed. Each time one or more United States longshore workers are dispatched in response to the request under
§655.534, the employer shall retain a written record of whether transportation to the vessel was provided and the
time and distance from the point of embarkation to the vessel.
§655.536 The third attestation element for locations in Alaska: No intention or design to influence
bargaining representative election.

(a) The employer shall attest that use of alien crewmembers to perform the longshore activity specified on the
Form ETA 9033-A is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in
the State of Alaska.
(b) Documentation. The employer need not develop nor maintain documentation to substantiate the statement
referenced in paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of an investigation, however, the employer has the burden of
proof to show that the use of alien crewmembers to perform the longshore activity specified on the Form ETA 9033A was not intended nor designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the State of
Alaska.
§655.537 The fourth attestation element for locations in Alaska: Notice of filing.
(a)(1) The employer shall attest that at the time of filing the attestation, notice of filing has been provided to:
(i) Labor organizations which have been recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States
longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.) and which make
available or intend to make available workers to the particular location where the longshore work is to be performed;
(ii) Contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at the
location where the longshore work is to be performed; and
(iii) Operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.
(2) The notices provided under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall include a copy of the Form ETA 9033-A
to be submitted to ETA, shall provide information concerning the availability of supporting documents for public
examination at the national office of ETA, and shall include the following statement: “Complaints alleging a
misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation and/or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation may be
filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.”
(b) The employer shall request a copy of the Certificate of Compliance issued by the district director of the
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs under section 37 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act (33 U.S.C. 932) from the parties to whom notice is provided pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this
section. An employer's obligation to make a bona fide request for dispatch of U.S. longshore workers under
§655.534 of this part before using alien crewmembers to perform the longshore work attested to shall commence
upon receipt of the copy of the Certificate of Compliance.
(c) Documentation. The employer shall develop and maintain documentation sufficient to meet its burden of
proving the validity of the statement referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and attested to on the Form
ETA 9033-A. Such documentation shall include a copy of the notices provided, as required by paragraph (a)(1) of
this section, and shall be submitted to ETA along with the Form ETA 9033-A.
§655.538 Actions on attestations submitted for filing for locations in Alaska.
Once an attestation has been received from an employer, a determination shall be made by the Certifying
Officer whether to accept the attestation for filing or return it. The Certifying Officer may request additional
explanation and/or documentation from the employer in making this determination. An attestation which is properly
filled out and which includes accompanying documentation for the requirement set forth at §655.537 of this part
shall be accepted for filing by ETA on the date it is signed by the Certifying Officer unless it falls within one of the
categories set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Once an attestation is accepted for filing, ETA shall then follow
the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Upon acceptance of the employer's attestation by ETA,
the attestation and accompanying documentation shall be forwarded to and be available for public examination at
the ETA national office in a timely manner. ETA shall not consider information contesting an attestation received by
ETA prior to the determination to accept or return the attestation for filing. Such information shall not be made a

part of ETA's administrative record on the attestation, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a complaint
pursuant to subpart G of this part if the attestation is accepted by ETA for filing.
(a) Acceptance. (1) If the attestation is properly filled out and includes accompanying documentation for the
requirement set forth at §655.537, and does not fall within one of the categories set forth at paragraph (b) of this
section, ETA shall accept the attestation for filing, provide notification to the DHS office having jurisdiction over
the location where longshore work will be performed, and return to the employer, or the employer's agent or
representative at a U.S. address, one copy of the attestation form submitted by the employer, with ETA's acceptance
indicated thereon. Before using alien crewmembers to perform the longshore work attested to on Form ETA 9033A, the employer shall make a bona fide request for and employ United States longshore workers who are qualified
and available in sufficient numbers pursuant to §§655.534 and 655.535. Where such a request for dispatch of United
States longshore workers is unsuccessful, either in whole or in part, any use of alien crewmembers to perform
longshore activity shall be in accordance with DHS regulations.
(2) DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or adequacy of an attestation accepted for filing.
(b) Unacceptable attestations. ETA shall not accept an attestation for filing and shall return such attestation to
the employer, or the employer's agent or representative at a U.S. address, when any one of the following conditions
exists:
(1) When the Form ETA 9033-A is not properly filled out. Examples of improperly filled out Form ETA
9033-A's include instances where the employer has neglected to check all the necessary boxes, where the employer
has failed to include the name of any port, city, or other geographical reference point where longshore work is to be
performed, or where the employer has failed to sign the attestation or to designate an agent in the United States.
(2) When the Form ETA 9033-A with accompanying documentation is not received by ETA at least 30 days
prior to the first performance of the longshore activity, unless the employer is claiming that it could not have
reasonably anticipated the need to file the attestation for that location at that time, and has included documentation
which supports this contention, and ETA has found the claim to be valid.
(3) When the Form ETA 9033-A does not include accompanying documentation for the requirement set forth
at §655.537.
(4) When the accompanying documentation submitted by the employer and required by §655.537, on its face,
is inconsistent with that section. Examples of such a situation include an instance where the Form ETA 9033-A
indicates that the longshore work will be performed at a particular private dock and the documentation required
under the notice attestation element indicates that notice was provided to an operator of a different private dock, or
where the longshore work is to be performed at a particular time and location in the State of Alaska and the notice of
filing provided to qualified labor organizations and contract stevedoring companies indicates that the longshore
work is to be performed at a different time and/or location.
(5) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, after an investigation
pursuant to subpart G of this part, that a cease and desist order has been issued pursuant to subpart G of this part,
with respect to the attesting employer's performance of longshore work at a particular location in the State of
Alaska, in violation of a previously accepted attestation.
(6) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, after an investigation
pursuant to subpart G of this part, that the particular employer has misrepresented or failed to comply with an
attestation previously submitted and accepted for filing, but in no case for a period of more than one year after the
date of the Administrator's notice and provided that DHS has not advised ETA that the prohibition is in effect for a
lesser period.

(7) When the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA, in writing, that the employer has
failed to comply with any penalty, sanction, or other remedy assessed in a final agency action following an
investigation by the Wage and Hour Division pursuant to subpart G of this part.
(c) Resubmission. If the attestation is not accepted for filing pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, ETA
shall return to the employer, or the employer's agent or representative, at a U.S. address, the attestation form and
accompanying documentation submitted by the employer. ETA shall notify the employer, in writing, of the
reason(s) that the attestation is unacceptable. When an attestation is found to be unacceptable pursuant to paragraph
(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, the employer may resubmit the corrected attestation with the proper
documentation. When an attestation is found to be unacceptable pursuant to paragraph (b) (5), (6), or (7) of this
section and returned, such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary of Labor.
§655.539 Effective date and validity of filed attestations for locations in Alaska.
An attestation is filed and effective as of the date it is accepted and signed by the Certifying Officer. Such
attestation is valid for the 12-month period beginning on the date of acceptance for filing, unless suspended or
invalidated pursuant to §655.540 of this part. The filed attestation expires at the end of the 12-month period of
validity.
§655.540 Suspension or invalidation of filed attestations for locations in Alaska.
Suspension or invalidation of an attestation may result from enforcement action(s) under subpart G of this part
(i.e., investigation(s) conducted by the Administrator or cease and desist order(s) issued by the Administrator
regarding the employer's misrepresentation in or failure to carry out its attestation); or from a discovery by ETA that
it made an error in accepting the attestation because such attestation falls within one of the categories set forth in
§655.538(b).
(a) Result of Wage and Hour Division action. Upon the determination of a violation under subpart G of this
part, the Administrator shall, pursuant to §655.665(b), notify the DHS of the violation and of the Administrator's
notice to ETA.
(b) Result of ETA action. If, after accepting an attestation for filing, ETA finds that the attestation is
unacceptable because it falls within one of the categories set forth at §655.538(b) and, as a result, ETA suspends or
invalidates the attestation, ETA shall notify the DHS of such suspension or invalidation and shall return a copy of
the attestation form to the employer, or the employer's agent or representative at a U.S. address. ETA shall notify the
employer, in writing, of the reason(s) that the attestation is suspended or invalidated.
§655.541 Withdrawal of accepted attestations for locations in Alaska.
(a) An employer who has submitted an attestation which has been accepted for filing may withdraw such
attestation at any time before the 12-month period of its validity terminates, unless the Administrator has found
reasonable cause under subpart G to commence an investigation of the particular attestation. Such withdrawal may
be advisable, for example, when the employer learns that the country in which the vessel is registered and of which
nationals of such country hold a majority of the ownership interest in the vessel has been removed from the nonreciprocity list (which means, for purposes of this section, Prohibitions on longshore work by U.S. nationals; listing
by country at 22 CFR 89.1). In that event, an attestation would no longer be required under subpart F of this part,
since upon being removed from the non-reciprocity list the performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers
would be permitted under the reciprocity exception at sec. 258(e) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1288(e)). Requests for
withdrawals shall be in writing and shall be directed to the Certifying Officer.
(b) Withdrawal of an attestation shall not affect an employer's liability with respect to any failure to meet the
conditions attested to which took place before the withdrawal, or for misrepresentations in an attestation. However,
if an employer has not yet performed the longshore activities at the location(s) in question, the Administrator shall
not find reasonable cause to investigate unless it is alleged, and there is reasonable cause to believe, that the

employer has made misrepresentations in the attestation or documentation thereof, or that the employer has not in
fact given the notice attested to.

PUBLIC ACCESS
§655.550 Public access.
(a) Public examination at ETA. ETA shall make available for public examination in Washington, DC, a list of
employers which have filed attestations under this subpart, and for each such employer, a copy of the employer's
attestation and accompanying documentation it has received.
(b) Notice to public. ETA periodically shall publish a list in the FEDERAL REGISTER identifying under this
subpart employers which have submitted attestations; employers which have attestations on file; and employers
which have submitted attestations which have been found unacceptable for filing.

Subpart G—Enforcement of the Limitations Imposed on Employers Using Alien
Crewmembers for Longshore Activities in U.S. Ports
SOURCE: 60 FR 3969, 3977, Jan. 19, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

§655.600 Enforcement authority of Administrator, Wage and Hour Division.
(a) The Administrator shall perform all the Secretary's investigative and enforcement functions under section
258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1288) and subparts F and G of this part.
(b) The Administrator, pursuant to a complaint, shall conduct such investigations as may be appropriate and,
in connection therewith, enter and inspect such places and such records (and make transcriptions or copies thereof),
question such persons and gather such information as deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine
compliance regarding the matters which are the subject of the investigation.
(c) An employer being investigated shall make available to the Administrator such records, information,
persons, and places as the Administrator deems appropriate to copy, transcribe, question, or inspect. No employer
subject to the provisions of section 258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1288) and subparts F and G of this part shall interfere
with any official of the Department of Labor performing an investigation, inspection or law enforcement function
pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1288 or subpart F or G of this part. Any such interference shall be a violation of the attestation
and subparts F and G of this part, and the Administrator may take such further actions as the Administrator
considers appropriate. (NOTE: Federal criminal statutes prohibit certain interference with a Federal officer in the
performance of official duties. 18 U.S.C. 111 and 18 U.S.C. 1114.)
(d)(1) An employer subject to subparts F and G of this part shall at all times cooperate in administrative and
enforcement proceedings. No employer shall intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, retaliate, or
in any manner discriminate against any person because such person has:
(i) Filed a complaint or appeal under or related to section 258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1288) or subpart F or G of
this part;
(ii) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to section 258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1288)
or subpart F or G of this part;
(iii) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself or herself or others any right or protection afforded by section
258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1288) or subpart F or G of this part.
(iv) Consulted with an employee of a legal assistance program or an attorney on matters related to section 258
of the Act or to subpart F or G of this part or any other DOL regulation promulgated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1288.
(2) In the event of such intimidation or restraint as are described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the
conduct shall be a violation of the attestation and subparts F and G of this part, and the Administrator may take such
further actions as the Administrator considers appropriate.
(e) The Administrator shall, to the extent possible under existing law, protect the confidentiality of any person
who provides information to the Department in confidence in the course of an investigation or otherwise under
subpart F or G of this part. However, confidentiality will not be afforded to the complainant or to information
provided by the complainant.
§655.605 Complaints and investigative procedures.

(a) The Administrator, through an investigation, shall determine whether a basis exists to make a finding that:
(1) An attesting employer has—
(i) Failed to meet conditions attested to; or
(ii) Misrepresented a material fact in an attestation.
(NOTE: Federal criminal statutes provide penalties of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 5 years for knowing and
willful submission of false statements to the Federal Government. 18 U.S.C. 1001; see also 18 U.S.C. 1546.); or

(2) In the case of an employer operating under the automated vessel exception to the prohibition on utilizing
alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity(ies) at a U.S. port, the employer—
(i) Is utilizing alien crewmember(s) to perform longshore activity(ies) at a port where the prevailing practice
has not been to use such workers for such activity(ies); or
(ii) Is utilizing alien crewmember(s) to perform longshore activities:
(A) During a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute at the U.S. port; and/or
(B) With intent or design to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers at the U.S. port;
or
(3) An employer failed to comply in any other manner with the provisions of subpart F or G of this part.
(b) Any aggrieved person or organization may file a complaint of a violation of the provisions of subpart F or
G of this part.
(1) No particular form of complaint is required, except that the complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be
reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives the complaint.
(2) The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine—
(i) Whether, in the case of an attesting employer, there is reasonable cause to believe that particular part or
parts of the attestation or regulations have been violated; or
(ii) Whether, in the case of an employer claiming the automated vessel exception, the preponderance of the
evidence submitted by any interested party shows that conditions exist that would require the employer to file an
attestation.
(3) The complaint may be submitted to any local Wage and Hour Division office; the addresses of such offices
are found in local telephone directories. The office or person receiving such a complaint shall refer it to the office of
the Wage and Hour Division administering the area in which the reported violation is alleged to have occurred.
(c) The Administrator shall determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint warrants
investigation. If the Administrator determines that the complaint fails to present reasonable cause for an
investigation, the Administrator shall so notify the complainant, who may submit a new complaint, with such
additional information as may be necessary. There shall be no hearing pursuant to §655.625 for the Administrator's
determination not to conduct an investigation. If the Administrator determines that an investigation on the complaint
is warranted, the investigation shall be conducted and a determination issued within 180 calendar days of the
Administrator's receipt of the complaint, or later for good cause shown.

(d) In conducting an investigation, the Administrator may consider and make part of the investigation file any
evidence or materials that have been compiled in any previous investigation regarding the same or a closely related
matter.
(e) In conducting an investigation under an attestation, the Administrator shall take into consideration the
employer's burden to provide facts and evidence to establish the matters asserted. In conducting an investigation
regarding an employer's eligibility for the automated vessel exception, the Administrator shall not impose the burden
of proof on the employer, but shall consider all evidence from any interested party in determining whether the
employer is not eligible for the exception.
(f) In an investigation regarding the use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity(ies) in a U.S. port
(whether by an attesting employer or by an employer claiming the automated vessel exception), the Administrator
shall accept as conclusive proof a previous Departmental determination, published in the FEDERAL REGISTER
pursuant to §655.670, establishing that such use of alien crewmembers is not the prevailing practice for the
activity(ies) and U.S. port at issue. The Administrator shall give appropriate weight to a previous Departmental
determination published in the FEDERAL REGISTER pursuant to §655.670, establishing that at the time of such
determination, such use of alien crewmembers was the prevailing practice for the activity(ies) and U.S. port at issue.
(g) When an investigation has been conducted, the Administrator shall, within the time period specified in
paragraph (c) of this section, issue a written determination as to whether a basis exists to make a finding stated in
paragraph (a) of this section. The determination shall be issued and an opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded in
accordance with the procedures specified in §655.625(d) of this part.
§655.610 Automated vessel exception to prohibition on utilization of alien crewmember(s) to perform
longshore activity(ies) at a U.S. port.
(a) The Act establishes a rebuttable presumption that the prevailing practice in U.S. ports is for automated
vessels (i.e., vessels equipped with automated self- unloading conveyor belts or vacuum-actuated systems) to use
alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity(ies) through the use of the self-unloading equipment. An employer
claiming the automated vessel exception does not have the burden of establishing eligibility for the exception.
(b) In the event of a complaint asserting that an employer claiming the automated vessel exception is not
eligible for such exception, the Administrator shall determine whether the preponderance of the evidence submitted
by any interested party shows that:
(1) It is not the prevailing practice at the U.S. port to use alien crewmember(s) to perform the longshore
activity(ies) through the use of the self-unloading equipment; or
(2) The employer is using alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity(ies)—
(i) During a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute at the U.S. port; and/or
(ii) With intent or design to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers at the U.S. port.
(c) In making the prevailing practice determination required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the
Administrator shall determine whether, in the 12-month period preceding the date of the Administrator's receipt of
the complaint, one of the following conditions existed:
(1) Over fifty percent of the automated vessels docking at the port used alien crewmembers for the activity
(for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a vessel shall be counted each time it docks at the particular
port); or

(2) Alien crewmembers made up over fifty percent of the workers who performed the activity with respect to
such automated vessels.
(d) An interested party, complaining that the automated vessel exception is not applicable to a particular
employer, shall provide to the Administrator evidence such as:
(1) A written summary of a survey of the experience of masters of automated vessels which entered the local
port in the previous year, describing the practice in the port as to the use of alien crewmembers;
(2) A letter, affidavit, or other written statement from an appropriate local port authority regarding the use of
alien crewmembers to perform the longshore activity at the port in the previous year;
(3) Written statements from collective bargaining representatives and/or shipping agents with direct
knowledge of practices regarding the use of alien crewmembers at the port in the previous year.
§655.615 Cease and desist order.
(a) If the Administrator determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to an
attestation, the complainant may request that the Administrator enter a cease and desist order against the employer
against whom the complaint is lodged.
(1) The request for a cease and desist order may be filed along with the complaint, or may be filed
subsequently. The request, including all accompanying documents, shall be filed in duplicate with the same Wage
and Hour Division office that received the complaint.
(2) No particular form is prescribed for a request for a cease and desist order pursuant to this paragraph (a).
However, any such request shall:
(i) Be dated;
(ii) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(iii) Specify the attestation provision(s) with respect to which the employer allegedly failed to comply and/or
submitted misrepresentation(s) of material fact(s);
(iv) Be accompanied by evidence to substantiate the allegation(s) of noncompliance and/or misrepresentation;
(v) Be signed by the complaining party making the request or by the authorized representative of such party;
(vi) Include the address at which such complaining party or authorized representative desires to receive further
communications relating thereto.
(3) Upon receipt of a request for a cease and desist order, the Administrator shall promptly notify the
employer of the request. The Administrator's notice shall:
(i) Inform the employer that it may respond to the request and meet with a Wage and Hour Division official
within 14 calendar days of the date of the notice;
(ii) Be served upon the employer by facsimile transmission, in person, or by certified or regular mail, at the
address of the U.S. agent stated on the employer's attestation;

(iii) Be accompanied by copies of the complaint, the request for a cease and desist order, the evidence
submitted by the complainant, and any evidence from other investigation(s) of the same or a closely related matter
which the Administrator may incorporate into the record. (Any such evidence from other investigation(s) shall also
be made available for examination by the complaining party at the Wage and Hour Division office which issued the
notice.)
(4) No particular form is prescribed for the employer's response to the complaining party's request for a cease
and desist order under this paragraph (a), however, any such response shall:
(i) Be dated;
(ii) Be submitted by facsimile transmission, in person, by certified or regular mail, or by courier service to the
Wage and Hour Division office which issued the notice of the request;
(iii) Be received by the appropriate Wage and Hour Division office no later than 14 calendar days from the
date of the notice of the request;
(iv) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(v) Explain, in any detail desired by the employer, the employer's grounds or reasons as to why the
Administrator should deny the requested cease and desist order;
(vi) Be accompanied by evidence to substantiate the employer's grounds or reasons as to why the
Administrator should deny the requested cease and desist order;
(vii) Specify whether the employer desires an informal meeting with a Wage and Hour Division official;
(viii) Be signed by the employer or its authorized representative; and
(ix) Include the address at which the employer or its authorized representative desires to receive further
communications relating thereto, if such address is different from the address of the U.S. agent stated on the
attestation.
(5) In the event the employer requests a meeting with a Wage and Hour Division official, the Administrator
shall provide the employer and the complaining party, or their authorized representatives, an opportunity for such a
meeting to present their views regarding the evidence and arguments submitted by the parties. This shall be an
informal meeting, not subject to any procedural rules. The meeting shall be held within the 14 calendar days
permitted for the employer's response to the request for the cease and desist order, and shall be held at a time and
place set by the Wage and Hour Division official, who shall notify the parties.
(6) After receipt of the employer's timely response and after any informal meeting which may have been held
with the parties, the Administrator shall promptly issue a written determination, either denying the request or issuing
a cease and desist order. In making the determination, the Administrator shall consider all the evidence submitted,
including any evidence from the same or a closely related matter which the Administrator has incorporated into the
record and provided to the employer. If the Administrator determines that the complaining party's position is
supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Administrator shall order that the employer cease the
activities specified in the determination, until the completion of the Administrator's investigation and any
subsequent proceedings pursuant to §655.625 of this part, unless the prohibition is lifted by subsequent order of the
Administrator because it is later determined that the employer's position was correct. While the cease and desist
order is in effect, ETA shall suspend the subject attestation, either in whole or in part, and shall not accept any
subsequent attestation from the employer for the activity(ies) and U.S. port or location in the State of Alaska at
issue.

(7) The Administrator's cease and desist order shall be served on the employer at the address of its designated
U.S. based representative or at the address specified in the employer's response, by facsimile transmission, personal
service, or certified mail.
(b) If the Administrator determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to a
complaint that a non-attesting employer is not entitled to the automated vessel exception to the requirement for the
filing of an attestation, a complaining party may request that the Administrator enter a cease and desist order against
the employer against whom the complaint is lodged.
(1) The request for a cease and desist order may be filed along with the complaint, or may be filed
subsequently. The request, including all accompanying documents, shall be filed in duplicate with the same Wage
and Hour Division office that received the complaint.
(2) No particular form is prescribed for a request for a cease and desist order pursuant to this paragraph.
However, any such request shall:
(i) Be dated;
(ii) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(iii) Specify the circumstances which allegedly require that the employer be denied the use of the automated
vessel exception;
(iv) Be accompanied by evidence to substantiate the allegation(s);
(v) Be signed by the complaining party making the request or by the authorized representative of such party;
and
(vi) Include the address at which such complaining party or authorized representative desires to receive further
communications relating thereto.
(3) Upon receipt of a request for a cease and desist order, the Administrator shall notify the employer of the
request. The Administrator's notice shall:
(i) Inform the employer that it may respond to the request and meet with a Wage and Hour Division official
within 14 calendar days of the date of the notice;
(ii) Be served upon the employer by facsimile transmission, in person, or by certified or regular mail, at the
employer's last known address; and
(iii) Be accompanied by copies of the complaint, the request for a cease and desist order, the evidence
submitted by the complainant, and any evidence from other investigation(s) of the same or a closely related matter
which the Administrator may incorporate into the record. (Any such evidence from other investigation(s) shall also
be made available for examination by the complaining party at the Wage and Hour Division office which issued the
notice.)
(4) No particular form is prescribed for the employer's response to the complaining party's request for a cease
and desist order under this paragraph (b). However, any such response shall:
(i) Be dated;

(ii) Be submitted by facsimile transmission, in person, by certified or regular mail, or by courier service to the
Wage and Hour Division office which issued the notice of the request;
(iii) Be received by the appropriate Wage and Hour Division office no later than 14 calendar days from the
date of the notice of the request;
(iv) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(v) Explain, in any detail desired by the employer, the employer's grounds or reasons as to why the
Administrator should deny the requested cease and desist order;
(vi) Be accompanied by evidence to substantiate the employer's grounds or reasons as to why the
Administrator should deny the requested cease and desist order;
(vii) Specify whether the employer desires an informal meeting with a Wage and Hour Division official;
(viii) Be signed by the employer or its authorized representative; and
(ix) Include the address at which the employer or its authorized representative desires to receive further
communications relating thereto.
(5) In the event the employer requests a meeting with a Wage and Hour Division official, the Administrator
shall provide the employer and the complaining party, or their authorized representatives, an opportunity for such a
meeting to present their views regarding the evidence and arguments submitted by the parties. This shall be an
informal meeting, not subject to any procedural rules. The meeting shall be held within the 14 calendar days
permitted for the employer's response to the request for the cease and desist order, and shall be held at a time and
place set by the Wage and Hour Division official, who shall notify the parties.
(6) After receipt of the employer's timely response and after any informal meeting which may have been held
with the parties, the Administrator shall promptly issue a written determination, either denying the request or issuing
a cease and desist order. If the Administrator determines that the complaining party's position is supported by a
preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Administrator shall order that the employer cease the use of alien
crewmembers to perform the longshore activity(ies) specified in the order. In making the determination, the
Administrator shall consider all the evidence submitted, including any evidence from the same or a closely related
matter which the Administrator has incorporated into the record and provided to the employer. The order shall
remain in effect until the completion of the investigation and any subsequent hearing proceedings pursuant to
§655.625 of this part, unless the employer files and maintains on file with ETA an attestation pursuant to §655.520
of this part or unless the prohibition is lifted by subsequent order of the Administrator because it is later determined
that the employer's position was correct.
(7) The Administrator's cease and desist order shall be served on the employer or its designated representative
by facsimile transmission, personal service, or by certified mail at the address specified in the employer's response
or, if no such address was specified, at the employer's last known address.
§655.620 Civil money penalties and other remedies.
(a) The Administrator may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each alien crewmember with
respect to whom there has been a violation of the attestation or subpart F or G of this part. The Administrator may
also impose appropriate remedy(ies).
(b) In determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed, the Administrator shall consider the type
of violation committed and other relevant factors. The factors which may be considered include, but are not limited
to, the following:

(1) Previous history of violation, or violations, by the employer under the Act and subpart F or G of this part;
(2) The number of workers affected by the violation or violations;
(3) The gravity of the violation or violations;
(4) Efforts made by the violator in good faith to comply with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1288(c) and subparts
F and G of this part;
(5) The violator's explanation of the violation or violations;
(6) The violator's commitment to future compliance; and/or
(7) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation, or the potential financial
loss, potential injury or adverse effect with respect to other parties.
(c) The civil money penalty, and any other remedy determined by the Administrator to be appropriate, are
immediately due for payment or performance upon the assessment by the Administrator, or the decision by an
administrative law judge where a hearing is requested, or the decision by the Secretary where review is granted. The
employer shall remit the amount of the civil money penalty, by certified check or money order made payable to the
order of “Wage and Hour Division, Labor.” The remittance shall be delivered or mailed to the Wage and Hour
Division office for the area in which the violations occurred. The performance of any other remedy prescribed by the
Administrator shall follow procedures established by the Administrator. The employer's failure to pay the civil
money penalty, or to perform any other remedy prescribed by the Administrator, shall result in the rejection by ETA
of any future attestation submitted by the employer, until such payment or performance is accomplished.
§655.625 Written notice, service and Federal Register publication of Administrator's determination.
(a) The Administrator's determination, issued pursuant to §655.605 of this part, shall be served on the
complainant, the employer, and other known interested parties by personal service or by certified mail at the parties'
last known addresses. Where service by certified mail is not accepted by the party, the Administrator may exercise
discretion to serve the determination by regular mail.
(b) Where the Administrator determines the prevailing practice regarding the use of alien crewmember(s) to
perform longshore activity(ies) in a U.S. port (whether the Administrator's investigation involves an employer
operating under an attestation, or under the automated vessel exception), the Administrator shall, simultaneously
with issuance of the determination, publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER a notice of the determination. The notice shall
identify the activity(ies), the U.S. port, and the prevailing practice regarding the use of alien crewmembers. The
notice shall also inform interested parties that they may request a hearing pursuant to §655.630 of this part, within
15 days of the date of the determination.
(c) The Administrator shall file with the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Department of Labor, a copy
of the complaint and the Administrator's determination.
(d) The Administrator's written determination required by §655.605 of this part shall:
(1) Set forth the determination of the Administrator and the reason or reasons therefor, and in the case of a
finding of violation(s) by an attesting employer, prescribe any remedies, including the amount of any civil money
penalties assessed and the reason therefor, and/or any other remedies required for compliance with the employer's
attestation.
(2) Inform the interested parties that they may request a hearing pursuant to §655.625 of this part.

(3) Inform the interested parties that in the absence of a timely request for a hearing, received by the Chief
Administrative Law Judge within 15 calendar days of the date of the determination, the determination of the
Administrator shall become final and not appealable.
(4) Set forth the procedure for requesting a hearing, and give the address of the Chief Administrative Law
Judge (with whom the request must be filed) and the representative(s) of the Solicitor of Labor (upon whom copies
of the request must be served).
(5) Inform the parties that, pursuant to §655.665, the Administrator shall notify ETA and the DHS of the
occurrence of a violation by the attesting employer or of the non-attesting employer's ineligibility for the automated
vessel exception.
§655.630 Request for hearing.
(a) Any interested party desiring to request an administrative hearing on a determination issued pursuant to
§§655.605 and 655.625 of this part shall make such request in writing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge at the
address stated in the notice of determination.
(b) Interested parties may request a hearing in the following circumstances:
(1) The complainant or any other interested party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines,
after investigation, that there is no basis for a finding that an attesting employer has committed violation(s) or that
the employer is eligible for the automated vessel exception. In such a proceeding, the requesting party and the
employer shall be parties; the Administrator may intervene as a party or appear as amicus curiae at any time in the
proceeding, at the Administrator's discretion.
(2) The employer or any other interested party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines,
after investigation, that there is a basis for a finding that an attesting employer has committed violation(s) or that a
non- attesting employer is not eligible for the automated vessel exception. In such a proceeding, the Administrator
and the employer shall be parties.
(c) No particular form is prescribed for any request for hearing permitted by this section. However, any such
request shall:
(1) Be dated;
(2) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(3) Specify the issue or issues stated in the notice of determination giving rise to such request;
(4) State the specific reason or reasons why the party requesting the hearing believes such determination is in
error;
(5) Be signed by the party making the request or by an authorized representative of such party; and
(6) Include the address at which such party or authorized representative desires to receive further
communications relating thereto.
(d) The request for such hearing must be received by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, at the address
stated in the Administrator's notice of determination, no later than 15 calendar days after the date of the
determination. An interested party that fails to meet this 15-day deadline for requesting a hearing may thereafter
participate in the proceedings only by consent of the administrative law judge, either through intervention as a party
pursuant to 29 CFR 18.10 (b) through (d) or through participation as an amicus curiae pursuant to 18 CFR 18.12.

(e) The request may be filed in person, by facsimile transmission, by certified or regular mail, or by courier
service. For the requesting party's protection, if the request is filed by mail, it should be by certified mail. If the
request is filed by facsimile transmission, the original of the request, signed by the requestor or authorized
representative, shall be filed within ten days.
(f) Copies of the request for a hearing shall be sent by the requestor to the Wage and Hour Division official
who issued the Administrator's notice of determination, to the representative(s) of the Solicitor of Labor identified in
the notice of determination, and to all known interested parties.
§655.635 Rules of practice for administrative law judge proceedings.
(a) Except as specifically provided in this subpart, and to the extent they do not conflict with the provisions of
this subpart, the “Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative
Law Judges” established by the Secretary at 29 CFR part 18 shall apply to administrative proceedings under this
subpart.
(b) As provided in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556, any oral or documentary evidence may be
received in proceedings under this part. The Federal Rules of Evidence and subpart B of the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges (29 CFR part 18, subpart B)
shall not apply, but principles designed to ensure production of relevant and probative evidence shall guide the
admission of evidence. The administrative law judge may exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or
unduly repetitive.
§655.640 Service and computation of time.
(a) Under this subpart, a party may serve any pleading or document by regular mail. Service on a party is
complete upon mailing to the last known address or, in the case of the attesting employer, to the employer's
designated representative in the U.S. No additional time for filing or response is authorized where service is by mail.
In the interest of expeditious proceedings, the administrative law judge may direct the parties to serve pleadings or
documents by a method other than regular mail.
(b) Two (2) copies of all pleadings and other documents in any administrative law judge proceeding shall be
served on the attorneys for the Administrator. One copy shall be served on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair

(2) Determines that the prevailing practice for the particular activity in the port does not permit the use of alien
crewmembers.
(c) If the administrative law judge determines that the prevailing practice in that port does not permit such use
of alien crewmembers, the judge's decision shall be the conclusive determination for purposes of the Act and
subparts F and G of this part (unless and until reversed by the Secretary on discretionary review pursuant to
§655.655). The DHS and ETA shall upon notice from the Administrator, take the actions specified in §655.665.

(d) In the event that the Secretary, upon discretionary review pursuant to §655.655, issues a decision that
reverses the administrative law judge on a matter on which the Administrator has published notices in the FEDERAL
REGISTER pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Administrator shall publish in the FEDERAL
REGISTER a notice of the Secretary's decision and shall notify the DHS and ETA.
(1) Where the Secretary reverses the administrative law judge and determines that, contrary to the judge's

subparts F and G of this part. Upon notice from the Administrator, the DHS and ETA shall take the actions specified
in §655.665.

Subpart H—Labor Condition Applications and Requirements for Employers
Seeking To Employ Nonimmigrants on H-1b Visas in Specialty Occupations and
as Fashion Models, and Requirements for Employers Seeking To Employ
Nonimmigrants on H-1b1 and E-3 Visas in Specialty Occupations
SOURCE: 59 FR 65659, 65676, Dec. 20, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

§655.700 What statutory provisions govern the employment of H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants and
how do employers apply for H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visas?
Under the E-3 visa program, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended, permits certain
nonimmigrant treaty aliens to be admitted to the United States solely to perform services in a specialty occupation
(INA section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii)). Under the H-1B1 visa program, the INA permits nonimmigrant professionals in
specialty occupations from countries with which the United States has entered into certain agreements that are
identified in section 214(g)(8)(A) of the INA to temporarily enter the United States for employment in a specialty
occupation. Employers seeking to employ nonimmigrant workers in specialty occupations under H-1B, H-1B1, or E3 visas must file a labor condition application with the Department of Labor as described in §655.730(c) and (d).
Certain procedures described in this subpart H for obtaining a visa and entering the U.S. after the Department of
Labor attestation process, including procedures in §655.705, apply only to H-1B nonimmigrants. The procedures for
receiving an E-3 or H-1B1 visa and entering the U.S. on an E-3 or H-1B1 visa after the attestation process is
certified by the Department of Labor are identified in the regulations and procedures of the Department of State and
the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security. Consult
the Department of State (http://www.state.gov/) and USCIS (http://www.uscis.gov/) Web sites and regulations for
specific instructions regarding the E-3 and H-1B1 visas.
(a) Statutory provisions regarding H-1B visas. With respect to nonimmigrant workers entering the U.S. on H1B visas, which are available to nonimmigrant aliens in specialty occupations or certain fashion models from any
country, the INA, as amended, provides as follows:
(1) Establishes an annual ceiling (exclusive of spouses and children) on the number of foreign workers who
may be issued H-1B visas—

(i) 195,000 in fiscal year 2001;
(ii) 195,000 in fiscal year 2002;
(iii) 195,000 in fiscal year 2003; and
(iv) 65,000 in each succeeding fiscal year;
(2) Defines the scope of eligible occupations for which nonimmigrants may be issued H-1B visas and specifies
the qualifications that are required for entry as an H-1B nonimmigrant ;
(3) Requires an employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants to file a labor condition application (LCA)
agreeing to various attestation requirements and have it certified by the Department of Labor (DOL) before a
nonimmigrant may be provided H-1B status by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and
(4) Establishes an enforcement system under which DOL is authorized to determine whether an employer has
engaged in misrepresentation or failed to meet a condition of the LCA, and is authorized to impose fines and
penalties.
(b) Procedure for obtaining an H-1B visa classification. Before a nonimmigrant may be admitted to work in a
“specialty occupation” or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability in the United States under the H-1B
visa classification, there are certain steps which must be followed:
(1) First, an employer shall submit to the Department of Labor (DOL), and obtain DOL certification of, a
labor condition application (LCA). The requirements for obtaining a certified LCA are provided in this subpart. The
electronic LCA (Form ETA 9035E) is available at http://www.lca.doleta.gov. The paper-version LCA (Form ETA
9035) and the LCA cover pages (Form ETA 9035CP), which contain the full attestation statements incorporated by
reference into Form ETA 9035 and Form ETA 9035E, may be obtained from http://ows.doleta.gov and from the
Employment and Training Administration (ETA) National Office. Employers must file LCAs in the manner
prescribed in §655.720.
(2) After obtaining DOL certification of an LCA, the employer may submit a nonimmigrant visa petition
(DHS Form I-129), together with the certified LCA, to DHS, requesting H-1B classification for the foreign worker.
The requirements concerning the submission of a petition to, and its processing by, DHS are set forth in DHS
regulations. The DHS petition (Form I-129) may be obtained from an DHS district or area office.
(3) If DHS approves the H-1B classification, the nonimmigrant then may apply for an H-1B visa abroad at a
consular office of the Department of State. If the nonimmigrant is already in the United States in a status other than
H-1B, he/she may apply to the DHS for a change of visa status.
(c) Applicability. (1) This subpart H and subpart I of this part apply to all employers seeking to employ foreign
workers under the H-1B visa classification in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and
ability.
(2) During the period that the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) apply, this subpart H and subpart I of this part shall apply (except for the provisions
relating to the recruitment and displacement of U.S. workers (see §§655.738 and 655.739)) to the entry and
employment of a nonimmigrant who is a citizen of Mexico under and pursuant to the provisions of section D or
Annex 1603 of NAFTA in the case of all professions set out in Appendix 1603.D.1 of Annex 1603 of NAFTA other
than registered nurses. Therefore, the references in this part to “H-1B nonimmigrant” apply to any Mexican citizen
nonimmigrant who is classified by DHS as “TN.” In the case of a registered nurse, the following provisions shall

apply: subparts D and E of this part or the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-95)
and the regulations issued thereunder, 20 CFR part 655, subparts L and M.
(3) E-3 visas: Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this subpart H and subpart I of this part
apply to all employers seeking to employ foreign workers under the E-3 visa classification in specialty occupations
under INA section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)). This paragraph (c)(3) applies to labor condition
applications filed on or after April 11, 2008. E-3 labor condition applications filed prior to that date but on or after
May 11, 2005 (i.e., the effective date of the statute), will be processed according to the E-3 statutory terms and the
E-3 processing procedures published on July 19, 2005 in the FEDERAL REGISTER at 74 FR 41434.
(4) H-1B1 visas: Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, subparts H and I of this part apply to all
employers seeking to employ foreign workers under the H-1B1 visa classification in specialty occupations described
in INA section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)), under the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore Free
Trade Agreements as long as the Agreements are in effect. (INA section 214(g)(8)(A) (8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(8)(A)).
This paragraph (c)(4) applies to H-1B1 labor condition applications filed on or after November 23, 2004. Further, H1B1 labor condition applications filed prior to that date but on or after January 1, 2004, the effective date of the H1B1 program, will be handled according to the H-1B1 statutory terms and the H-1B1 processing procedures as
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(d) Nonimmigrants on E-3 or H-1B1 visas—(1) Exclusions. The following sections in this subpart and in
subpart I of this part do not apply to E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants, but apply only to H-1B nonimmigrants:
§§655.700(a), (b), (c)(1) and (2); 655.710(b); 655.730(d)(5) and (e); 655.735; 655.736; 655.737; 655.738; 655.739;
655.760(a)(7), (8), (9), and (10); and 655.805(a)(7), (8), and (9). Further, the following references in subparts H or I
of this part, whether in the excluded sections listed above or elsewhere, do not apply to E-3 and H-1B1
nonimmigrants, but apply only to H-1B nonimmigrants: references to fashion models of distinguished merit and
ability (H-1B visas, but not H-1B1 and E-3 visas, are available to such fashion models); references to a petition
process before USCIS (the petition process applies only to H-1B, but not to initial H-1B1 and E-3 visas unless it is a
petition to accord a change of status); references to additional attestation obligations of H-1B-dependent employers
and employers found to have willfully violated the H-1B program requirements (these provisions do not apply to the
H-1B1 and E-3 programs); and references in §655.750(a) or elsewhere in this part to the provision in INA section
214(n) (formerly INA section 214(m)) (8 U.S.C. 1184(n)) regarding increased portability of H-1B status (by the
statutory terms, the portability provision is inapplicable to H-1B1 and E-3 nonimmigrants).
(2) Terminology. For purposes of subparts H and I of this part, except in those sections identified in paragraph
(d)(1) of this section as inapplicable to E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants and as otherwise excluded:
(i) The term “H-1B” includes “E-3” and “H-1B1” (INA section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and (a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)) (8
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and (a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)); and
(ii) The term “labor condition application” or “LCA” includes a labor attestation made under section 212(t)(1)
of the INA for an E-3 or H-1B1 nonimmigrant professional classified under INA section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and
(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and (a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)).
(3) Filing procedures for E-3 and H-1B1 labor attestations. Employers seeking to employ an E-3 or H-1B1
nonimmigrant must submit a completed ETA Form 9035 or ETA Form 9035E (electronic) to DOL in the manner
prescribed in §§655.720 and 655.730. Employers must indicate on the form whether the labor condition application
is for an “E-3 Australia,” “H-1B1 Chile,” or “H-1B1 Singapore” nonimmigrant. Any changes in the procedures and
instructions for submitting labor condition applications will be provided in a notice published in the FEDERAL
REGISTER and posted on the ETA Web site at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/.
(4) Employer's responsibilities regarding E-3 and H-1B1 labor attestation. Each employer seeking an E-3 or
H-1B1 nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation has several responsibilities, as described more fully in subparts H
and I of this part, including the following:

(i) By submitting a signed and completed LCA, the employer makes certain representations and agrees to
several attestations regarding the employer's responsibilities, including the wages, working conditions, and benefits
to be provided to the E-3 or H-1B1 nonimmigrant. These attestations are specifically identified and incorporated in
the LCA, and are fully described on Form ETA 9035CP (cover pages).
(ii) The employer reaffirms its acceptance of all of the attestation obligations by transmitting the certified
labor attestation to the nonimmigrant, the Department of State, and/or the USCIS according to the procedures of
those agencies.
(iii) The employer shall maintain the original signed and certified LCA in its files, and shall make a copy of
the filed LCA, as well as necessary supporting documentation (as identified under this subpart), available for public
examination in a public access file at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of
employment within one working day after the date on which the LCA is filed with ETA.
(iv) The employer shall develop sufficient documentation to meet its burden of proof, in the event that such
statement or information is challenged, with respect to the validity of the statements made in its LCA and the
accuracy of information provided. The employer shall also maintain such documentation at its principal place of
business in the U.S. and shall make such documentation available to DOL for inspection and copying upon request.
(5) Application to Chile. During the period that the provisions of Chapter 14 and Section D of Annex 14.3 of
the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (Chile FTA) are in effect, this subpart H and subpart I of this part
shall apply (except for the provisions excluded under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) to the temporary entry and
employment of a nonimmigrant who is a national of Chile under the provisions of Article 14.9 and Annex 2.1 of the
Chile FTA and who is a professional under the provisions of Annex 14.3(D) of the Chile FTA.

§655.705 What Federal agencies are involved in the H-1B and H-1B1 programs, and what are the
responsibilities of those agencies and of employers?
Four federal agencies (Department of Labor, Department of State, Department of Justice, and Department of
Homeland Security) are involved in the process relating to H-1B nonimmigrant classification and employment. The
employer also has continuing responsibilities under the process. This section briefly describes the responsibilities of
each of these entities.
(a) Department of Labor (DOL) responsibilities. DOL administers the labor condition application process and
enforcement provisions (exclusive of complaints regarding non-selection of U.S. workers, as described in 8 U.S.C.
1182(n)(1)(G)(i)(II) and 1182(n)(5)). Two DOL agencies have responsibilities:
(1) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is responsible for receiving and certifying labor
condition applications (LCAs) in accordance with this subpart H. ETA is also responsible for compiling and
maintaining a list of LCAs and makes such list available for public examination at the Department of Labor, 200
Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210.

(2) The Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) is responsible, in
accordance with subpart I of this part, for investigating and determining an employer's misrepresentation in or
failure to comply with LCAs in the employment of H-1B nonimmigrants.
(b) Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State (DOS)
responsibilities. The Department of State, through U.S. Embassies and Consulates, is responsible for issuing H-1B,
H-1B1, and E-3 visas. For H-1B visas, the following agencies are involved: DHS accepts the employer's petition
(DHS Form I-129) with the DOL-certified LCA attached. In doing so, the DHS determines whether the petition is
supported by an LCA which corresponds with the petition, whether the occupation named in the labor condition
application is a specialty occupation or whether the individual is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability,
and whether the qualifications of the nonimmigrant meet the statutory requirements for H-1B visa classification. If
the petition is approved, DHS will notify the U.S. Consulate where the nonimmigrant intends to apply for the visa
unless the nonimmigrant is in the U.S. and eligible to adjust status without leaving this country. See 8 U.S.C.
1255(h)(2)(B)(i). The Department of Justice administers the system for the enforcement and disposition of
complaints regarding an H-1B-dependent employer's or willful violator employer's failure to offer a position filled
by an H-1B nonimmigrant to an equally or better qualified United States worker (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(E),
1182(n)(5)), or such employer's willful misrepresentation of material facts relating to this obligation. DHS, is
responsible for disapproving H-1B and other petitions filed by an employer found to have engaged in
misrepresentation or failed to meet certain conditions of the labor condition application (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(C)(i)(iii); 1182(n)(5)(E)). DOL and DOS are involved in the process relating to the initial issuance of H-1B1 and E-3
visas. DHS is involved in change of status and extension of stays for the H-1B1 and E-3 category.
(c) Employer's responsibilities. This paragraph applies only to the H-1B program; employer's responsibilities
under the H-1B1 and E-3 programs are found at §655.700(d)(4). Each employer seeking an H-1B nonimmigrant in a
specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability has several responsibilities, as
described more fully in this subpart and subpart I of this part, including:
(1) The employer shall submit a completed labor condition application (LCA) on Form ETA 9035E or Form
ETA 9035 in the manner prescribed in §655.720. By completing and submitting the LCA, and by signing the LCA,
the employer makes certain representations and agrees to several attestations regarding its responsibilities, including
the wages, working conditions, and benefits to be provided to the H-1B nonimmigrants (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)); these
attestations are specifically identified and incorporated by reference in the LCA, as well as being set forth in full on
Form ETA 9035CP. The LCA contains additional attestations for certain H-1B-dependent employers and employers
found to have willfully violated the H-1B program requirements; these attestations impose certain obligations to
recruit U.S. workers, to offer the job to U.S. applicants who are equally or better qualified than the H-1B
nonimmigrant(s) sought for the job, and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers (either in the employer's
workforce, or in the workforce of a second employer with whom the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is placed, where there
are indicia of employment with a second employer (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(E)-(G)). These additional attestations are
specifically identified and incorporated by reference in the LCA, as well as being set forth in full on Form ETA
9035CP. If ETA certifies the LCA, notice of the certification will be sent to the employer by the same means the
employer used to submit the LCA (that is, electronically where the Form ETA 9035E was submitted electronically,
and by U.S. Mail where the Form ETA 9035 was submitted by U.S. Mail). The employer reaffirms its acceptance of
all of the attestation obligations by submitting the LCA to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly
the Immigration and Naturalization Service or INS) in support of the Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, Form I129, for an H-1B nonimmigrant. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(B)(2), which specifies the employer will comply with
the terms of the LCA for the duration of the H-1B nonimmigrant's authorized period of stay.
(2) The employer shall maintain the original signed and certified LCA in its files, and shall make a copy of the
LCA, as well as necessary supporting documentation (as identified under this subpart), available for public
examination in a public access file at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of
employment within one working day after the date on which the LCA is filed with ETA.
(3) The employer then may submit a copy of the certified, signed LCA to DHS with a completed petition
(Form I-129) requesting H-1B classification.

(4) The employer shall not allow the nonimmigrant worker to begin work until DHS grants the alien
authorization to work in the United States for that employer or, in the case of a nonimmigrant previously afforded
H-1B status who is undertaking employment with a new H-1B employer, until the new employer files a
nonfrivolous petition (Form I-129) in accordance with DHS requirements.
(5) The employer shall develop sufficient documentation to meet its burden of proof with respect to the
validity of the statements made in its LCA and the accuracy of information provided, in the event that such
statement or information is challenged. The employer shall also maintain such documentation at its principal place
of business in the U.S. and shall make such documentation available to DOL for inspection and copying upon
request.

condition application or failure of the employer to meet a condition specified in the application shall be filed with
the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division (Administrator), ESA, according to the procedures set forth in subpart I
of this part. The Administrator shall investigate where appropriate, and after an opportunity for a hearing, assess
appropriate sanctions and penalties, as described in subpart I of this part.
(b) Complaints arising under section 212(n)(1)(G)(i)(II) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(G)(i)(II), alleging
failure of the employer to offer employment to an equally or better qualified U.S. applicant, or an employer's
misrepresentation regarding such offer(s) of employment, may be filed with the Department of Justice, Civil Rights
Division, Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, 950 Pennsylvania
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530, Telephone: 1-800-255-8155 (employers), 1-800-255-7688 (employees);
Web address: http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc. The Department of Justice shall investigate where appropriate, and take
action as appropriate under that Department's regulations and procedures.

§655.715 Definitions.
For the purposes of subparts H and I of this part:
Actual wage means the wage rate paid by the employer to all individuals with experience and qualifications
similar to the H-1B nonimmigant's experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question at the
place of employment. The actual wage established by the employer is not an average of the wage rates paid to all
workers employed in the occupation.
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) means an official appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105.
Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration, Department of Labor, and such authorized representatives as may be designated to perform any of
the functions of the Administrator under subpart H or I of this part.
Aggrieved party means a person or entity whose operations or interests are adversely affected by the
employer's alleged non-compliance with the labor condition application and includes, but is not limited to:
(1) A worker whose job, wages, or working conditions are adversely affected by the employer's alleged noncompliance with the labor condition application;

(2) A bargaining representative for workers whose jobs, wages, or working conditions are adversely affected
by the employer's alleged non-compliance with the labor condition application;
(3) A competitor adversely affected by the employer's alleged non-compliance with the labor condition
application; and

with the labor condition application.
Area of intended employment means the area within normal commuting distance of the place (address) of
employment where the H-1B nonimmigrant is or will be employed. There is no rigid measure of distance which
constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual
circumstances among different areas (e.g., normal commuting distances might be 20, 30, or 50 miles). If the place of
employment is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or a Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA),
any place within the MSA or PMSA is deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of employment;
however, all locations within a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) will not automatically be
deemed to be within normal commuting distance. The borders of MSAs and PMSAs are not controlling with regard
to the identification of the normal commuting area; a location outside of an MSA or PMSA (or a CMSA) may be
within normal commuting distance of a location that is inside (e.g., near the border of) the MSA or PMSA (or
CMSA).
Attorney General means the chief official of the U.S. Department of Justice or the Attorney General's
designee.
Authorized agent and authorized representative mean an official of the employer who has the legal authority

admission of non-immigrants under H-1B visa for the purpose of employment.
Division means the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration, DOL.
Employed, employed by the employer, or employment relationship means the employment relationship as
determined under the common law, under which the key determinant is the putative employer's right to control the
means and manner in which the work is performed. Under the common law, “no shorthand formula or magic phrase

* * * can be applied to find the answer * * *. [A]ll of the incidents of the relationship must be assessed and
weighed with no one factor being decisive.” NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of America, 390 U.S. 254, 258 (1968).
Employer means a person, firm, corporation, contractor, or other association or organization in the United
States that has an employment relationship with H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrants and/or U.S. worker(s). In the
case of an H-1B nonimmigrant (not including E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants), the person, firm, contractor, or other
association or organization in the United States that files a petition with the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on behalf of the nonimmigrant is
deemed to be the employer of that nonimmigrant. In the case of an E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrant, the person, firm,
contractor, or other association or organization in the United States that files an LCA with the Department of Labor
on behalf of the nonimmigrant is deemed to be the employer of that nonimmigrant.
Employment and Training Administration (ETA) means the agency within the Department which includes the
Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).
Employment Standards Administration (ESA) means the agency within the Department which includes the

expertise in an occupational field.
Independent authoritative source survey means a survey of wages conducted by an independent authoritative
source and published in a book, newspaper, periodical, loose-leaf service, newsletter, or other similar medium,
within the 24-month period immediately preceding the filing of the employer's application. Such survey shall:
(1) Reflect the average wage paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment;
(2) Be based upon recently collected data—e.g., within the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of
publication of the survey; and
(3) Represent the latest published prevailing wage finding by the authoritative source for the occupation in the
area of intended employment.
Interested party means a person or entity who or which may be affected by the actions of an H-1B employer
or by the outcome of a particular investigation and includes any person, organization, or entity who or which has

provides national leadership and policy guidance and develops regulations and procedures to carry out the
responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor under the INA concerning alien workers seeking admission to the United
States in order to work under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.
Period of intended employment means the time period between the starting and ending dates inclusive of the
H-1B nonimmigrant's intended period of employment in the occupational classification at the place of employment
as set forth in the labor condition application.

Place of employment means the worksite or physical location where the work actually is performed by the H1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant.
(1) The term does not include any location where either of the following criteria—paragraph (1)(i) or (ii)—is
satisfied:
(i) Employee developmental activity. An H-1B worker who is stationed and regularly works at one location
may temporarily be at another location for a particular individual or employer-required developmental activity such
as a management conference, a staff seminar, or a formal training course (other than “on-the-job-training” at a
location where the employee is stationed and regularly works). For the H-1B worker participating in such activities,
the location of the activity would not be considered a “place of employment” or “worksite,” and that worker's
presence at such location—whether owned or controlled by the employer or by a third party—would not invoke H1B program requirements with regard to that employee at that location. However, if the employer uses H-1B
nonimmigrants as instructors or resource or support staff who continuously or regularly perform their duties at such
locations, the locations would be “places of employment” or “worksites” for any such employees and, thus, would
be subject to H-1B program requirements with regard to those employees.
(ii) Particular worker's job functions. The nature and duration of an H-1B nonimmigrant's job functions may
necessitate frequent changes of location with little time spent at any one location. For such a worker, a location
would not be considered a “place of employment” or “worksite” if the following three requirements (i.e., paragraphs
(1)(ii)(A) through (C)) are all met—
(A) The nature and duration of the H-1B worker's job functions mandates his/her short-time presence at the
location. For this purpose, either:
(1) The H-1B nonimmigrant's job must be peripatetic in nature, in that the normal duties of the worker's
occupation (rather than the nature of the employer's business) requires frequent travel (local or non-local) from
location to location; or
(2) The H-1B worker's duties must require that he/she spend most work time at one location but occasionally
travel for short periods to work at other locations; and
(B) The H-1B worker's presence at the locations to which he/she travels from the “home” worksite is on a
casual, short-term basis, which can be recurring but not excessive (i.e., not exceeding five consecutive workdays for
any one visit by a peripatetic worker, or 10 consecutive workdays for any one visit by a worker who spends most
work time at one location and travels occasionally to other locations); and
(C) The H-1B nonimmigrant is not at the location as a “strikebreaker” (i.e., the H-1B nonimmigrant is not
performing work in an occupation in which workers are on strike or lockout).
(2) Examples of “non-worksite” locations based on worker's job functions: A computer engineer sent out to
customer locations to “troubleshoot” complaints regarding software malfunctions; a sales representative making
calls on prospective customers or established customers within a “home office” sales territory; a manager
monitoring the performance of out-stationed employees; an auditor providing advice or conducting reviews at
customer facilities; a physical therapist providing services to patients in their homes within an area of employment;
an individual making a court appearance; an individual lunching with a customer representative at a restaurant; or an
individual conducting research at a library.
(3) Examples of “worksite” locations based on worker's job functions: A computer engineer who works on
projects or accounts at different locations for weeks or months at a time; a sales representative assigned on a
continuing basis in an area away from his/her “home office;” an auditor who works for extended periods at the
customer's offices; a physical therapist who “fills in” for full-time employees of health care facilities for extended
periods; or a physical therapist who works for a contractor whose business is to provide staffing on an “as needed”
basis at hospitals, nursing homes, or clinics.

(4) Whenever an H-1B worker performs work at a location which is not a “worksite” (under the criterion in
paragraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this definition), that worker's “place of employment” or “worksite” for purposes of H1B obligations is the worker's home station or regular work location. The employer's obligations regarding notice,
prevailing wage and working conditions are focused on the home station “place of employment” rather than on the
above-described location(s) which do not constitute worksite(s) for these purposes. However, whether or not a
location is considered to be a “worksite”/”place of employment” for an H-1B nonimmigrant, the employer is
required to provide reimbursement to the H-1B nonimmigrant for expenses incurred in traveling to that location on
the employer's business, since such expenses are considered to be ordinary business expenses of employers
(§§655.731(c)(7)(iii)(C); 655.731(c)(9)). In determining the worker's “place of employment” or “worksite,” the
Department will look carefully at situations which appear to be contrived or abusive; the Department would
seriously question any situation where the H-1B nonimmigrant's purported “place of employment” is a location
other than where the worker spends most of his/her work time, or where the purported “area of employment” does
not include the location(s) where the worker spends most of his/her work time.
Required wage rate means the rate of pay which is the higher of:
(1) The actual wage for the specific employment in question; or
(2) The prevailing wage rate (determined as of the time of filing the LCA application) for the occupation in
which the H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant is to be employed in the geographic area of intended employment.
The prevailing wage rate must be no less than the minimum wage required by Federal, State, or local law.
Secretary means the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee.
Specialty occupation:
(1) For purposes of the E-3 and H-1B programs (but not the H-1B1 program), specialty occupation means an
occupation that requires theoretical and practical application of a body of specialized knowledge, and attainment of a
bachelor's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in the specific specialty as a minimum for entry into the occupation in
the United States. The nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation shall possess the following qualifications:
(i) Full state licensure to practice in the occupation, if licensure is required for the occupation;
(ii) Completion of the required degree; or
(iii) Experience in the specialty equivalent to the completion of such degree and recognition of expertise in the
specialty through progressively responsible positions relating to the specialty. INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1) and (2).
(2) For purposes of the H-1B1 program, specialty occupation means an occupation that requires theoretical
and practical application of a body of specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree (or its
equivalent) in the specific specialty as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States. INA, 8 U.S.C.
1184(i)(3). For H-1B1 nonimmigrants from Chile, additional occupations that qualify as specialty occupations are
Disaster Relief Claims Adjuster, Management Consultant, Agricultural Manager, and Physical Therapist, as defined
in Appendix 14.3(D)(2) of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement. For H-1B1 nonimmigrants from
Singapore, additional occupations that qualify as specialty occupations are Disaster Relief Claims Adjuster and
Management Consultant, as defined in Appendix 11A.2 of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
(3) Determinations of specialty occupation and of nonimmigrant qualifications for the H-1B and H-1B1
programs are not made by the Department of Labor, but by the Department of State and/or United States Citizenship
and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with the procedures of
those agencies for processing visas, petitions, extensions of stay, or requests for change of nonimmigrant status for
H-1B or H-1B1 nonimmigrants.

Specific employment in question means the set of duties and responsibilities performed or to be performed by
the H-1B nonimmigrant at the place of employment.
State means one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
State Workforce Agency, formerly State Employment Security Agency or SESA means the State agency which,
under the State Administrator, is designated by the Governor to administer Wagner-Peyser Act funded employment
and workforce information services (State agency) and the State unemployment compensation program.
Strike means a labor dispute wherein employees engage in a concerted stoppage of work (including stoppage
by reason of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) or engage in any concerted slowdown or other
concerted interruption of operation.
United States worker (“U.S. worker”) means an employee who is either
(1) A citizen or national of the United States, or
(2) An alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, is admitted as a refugee
under section 207 of the INA, is granted asylum under section 208 of the INA, or is an immigrant otherwise
authorized (by the INA or by DHS) to be employed in the United States.
Wage rate means the remuneration (exclusive of fringe benefits) to be paid, stated in terms of amount per
hour, day, month or year (see definition of “Required Wage Rate”).

§655.720 Where are labor condition applications (LCAs) to be filed and processed?
(a) Employers must file all LCAs regarding H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants through the electronic
submission procedure identified in paragraph (b) of this section except as provided in the next sentence. If a physical
disability or lack of access to the Internet prevents an employer from using the electronic filing system, an LCA may
be filed by U.S. Mail in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Requirements for signing, providing
public access to, and use of certified LCAs are identified in §655.730(c). If the LCA is certified by DOL, notice of
the certification will be sent to the employer by the same means that the employer used to submit the LCA, that is,
electronically where the Form ETA 9035E was submitted electronically, and by U.S. Mail where the Form ETA
9035 was submitted by U.S. Mail.
(b) Electronic submission. Employers must file the electronic LCA, Form ETA 9035E, through the
Department of Labor's Web site at http://www.lca.doleta.gov. The employer must follow instructions for electronic
submission posted on the Web site. In the event ETA implements the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (44
U.S.C.A. 3504 n.) and/or the Electronic Records and Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN)
(15 U.S.C. 7001-7006) for the submission and certification of the Form ETA 9035E, instructions will be provided
(by public notice(s) and by instructions on the Department's Web site) to employers as to how the requirements of
these statutes will be met in the Form ETA 9035E procedures.
(c) Approval to file LCAs by U.S. Mail. (1) Employers with physical disabilities or lacking Internet access and
wishing to file LCAs by U.S. Mail may submit a written request to the Chief, Division of Foreign Labor
Certification in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section. The ETA shall identify the address
to which such written request shall be mailed in a Notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on the Department's Web
site at http://www.lca.doleta.gov.

(2) The written request must establish the employer's need to file by U.S. Mail, including providing an
explanation of how physical disability or lack of access to the Internet prevents the employer from using the
electronic filing system. No particular form or format is required for this request.
(3) ETA will review the submitted justification, and may require the employer to submit supporting
documentation. In the case of employers asserting a lack of Internet access, supporting documentation could, for
example, consist of documentation that the Internet cannot be accessed from the employer's worksite or physical
location (for example because no Internet service provider serves the site), and there is no publicly available Internet
access, at public libraries or elsewhere, within a reasonable distance of the employer. In the case of employers with
physical disabilities supporting documentation could, for example, consist of physicians' statements or invoices for
medical devices or aids relevant to the employer's disability.
(4) ETA may approve or deny employers' requests to submit LCAs by U.S. Mail. Approvals shall be valid for
1 year from the date of approval.
(d) U.S. Mail. If an employer has a valid approval to file by U.S. Mail in accordance with paragraph (c) of this
section, the employer may use Form ETA 9035 and send it by U.S. Mail to ETA. ETA shall publish a Notice in the
FEDERAL REGISTER identifying the address, and any future address changes, to which paper LCAs must be mailed,
and shall also post these addresses on the DOL Internet Web site at http://www.lca.doleta.gov. When Form ETA
9035 is submitted by U.S. Mail, the form must bear the original signature of the employer (or that of the employer's
authorized agent or representative) at the time it is submitted to ETA.
(e) The ETA National Office is responsible for policy questions and other issues regarding LCAs. Prevailing
wage challenges are handled in accordance with the procedures identified in §655.731(a)(2).
[70 FR 72561, Dec. 5, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 19949, Apr. 11, 2008]

§655.721 [Reserved]
§655.730 What is the process for filing a labor condition application?
This section applies to the filing of labor condition applications for H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants.
The term H-1B is meant to apply to all three categories unless exceptions are specifically noted.
(a) Who must submit labor condition applications? An employer, or the employer's authorized agent or
representative, which meets the definition of “employer” set forth in §655.715 and intends to employ an H-1B
nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability shall submit an LCA
to the Department.
(b) Where and when is an LCA to be submitted? An LCA shall be submitted by the employer to ETA in
accordance with the procedure prescribed in §655.720 no earlier than six months before the beginning date of the
period of intended employment shown on the LCA. It is the employer's responsibility to ensure ETA receives a
complete and accurate LCA. Incomplete or obviously inaccurate LCAs will not be certified by ETA. ETA will
process all LCAs sequentially and will usually make a determination to certify or not certify an LCA within seven
working days of the date ETA receives the LCA. LCAs filed by U.S. Mail may not be processed as quickly as those
filed electronically.
(c) What is to be submitted and what are its contents? Form ETA 9035 or ETA 9035E.
(1) General. The employer (or the employer's authorized agent or representative) must submit to ETA one
completed and dated LCA as prescribed in §655.720. The electronic LCA, Form ETA 9035E, is found on the DOL
Web site where the electronic submission is made, at http://www.lca.doleta.gov. Copies of the paper form, Form
ETA 9035, and cover pages Form ETA 9035CP are available on the DOL Web site at http://www.ows.doleta.gov

and from the ETA National Office, and may be used by employers with approval under §655.720 to file by U.S.
Mail during the approval's validity period.
(2) Undertaking of the Employer. In submitting the LCA, and by affixing the signature of the employer or its
authorized agent or representative on Form ETA 9035E or Form ETA 9035, the employer (or its authorized agent or
representative on behalf of the employer) attests the statements in the LCA are true and promises to comply with the
labor condition statements (attestations) specifically identified in Forms ETA 9035E and ETA 9035, as well as set
forth in full in the Form ETA 9035CP. The labor condition statements (attestations) are described in detail in
§§655.731 through 655.734, and the additional attestations for LCAs filed by certain H-1B-dependent employers
and employers found to have willfully violated the H-1B program requirements are described in §§655.736 through
655.739.
(3) Signed Originals, Public Access, and Use of Certified LCAs. In accordance with §655.760(a) and (a)(1),
the employer must maintain in its files and make available for public examination the LCA as submitted to ETA and
as certified by ETA. When Form ETA 9035E is submitted electronically, a signed original is created by the
employer (or by the employer's authorized agent or representative) printing out and signing the form immediately
upon certification by ETA. When Form ETA 9035 is submitted by U.S. Mail as permitted by §655.720(a), the form
must bear the original signature of the employer (or of the employer's authorized agent or representative) when
submitted to ETA. For H-1B visas only, the employer must submit a copy of the signed, certified Form ETA 9035 or
ETA 9035E to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly INS) in support of the Form I-129
petition, thereby reaffirming the employer's acceptance of all of the attestation obligations in accordance with 8 CFR
214.2(h)(4)(iii)(B)(2).
(4) Contents of LCA. Each LCA shall identify the occupational classification for which the LCA is being
submitted and shall state:
(i) The occupation, by Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) Three-Digit Occupational Groups code and
by the employer's own title for the job;
(ii) The number of nonimmigrants sought;
(iii) The gross wage rate to be paid to each nonimmigrant, expressed on an hourly, weekly, biweekly, monthly,
or annual basis;
(iv) The starting and ending dates of the nonimmigrants' employment;
(v) The place(s) of intended employment;
(vi) The prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment and the specific source (e.g.,
name of published survey) relied upon by the employer to determine the wage. If the wage is obtained from a SESA,
now known as a State Workforce Agency (SWA), the appropriate box must be checked and the wage must be stated;
the source for a wage obtained from a source other than a SWA must be identified along with the wage; and
(vii) For applications filed regarding H-1B nonimmigrants only (and not applications regarding H-1B1 and E3 nonimmigrants), the employer's status as to whether or not the employer is H-1B-dependent and/or a willful
violator, and, if the employer is H-1B-dependent and/or a willful violator, whether the employer will use the
application only in support of petitions for exempt H-1B nonimmigrants.
(5) Multiple positions and/or places of employment. The employer shall file a separate LCA for each
occupation in which the employer intends to employ one or more nonimmigrants, but the LCA may cover more than
one intended position (employment opportunity) within that occupation. All intended places of employment shall be
identified on the LCA; the employer may file one or more additional LCAs to identify additional places of
employment. Separate LCAs must be filed for H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants.

(6) Full-time and part-time jobs. The position(s) covered by the LCA may be either full-time or part-time;
full-time and part-time positions can not be combined on a single LCA.
(d) What attestations does the LCA contain? An employer's LCA shall contain the labor condition statements
referenced in §§655.731 through 655.734, and §655.736 through 655.739 (if applicable), which provide that no
individual may be admitted or provided status as an H-1B nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the
employer has filed with the Secretary an application stating that:
(1) The employer is offering and will offer during the period of authorized employment to H-1B
nonimmigrants no less than the greater of the following wages (such offer to include benefits and eligibility for
benefits provided as compensation for services, which are to be offered to the nonimmigrants on the same basis and
in accordance with the same criteria as the employer offers such benefits to U.S. workers):
(i) The actual wage paid to the employer's other employees at the worksite with similar experience and
qualifications for the specific employment in question; or
(ii) The prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of intended employment;
(2) The employer will provide working conditions for such nonimmigrants that will not adversely affect the
working conditions of workers similarly employed (including benefits in the nature of working conditions, which
are to be offered to the nonimmigrants on the same basis and in accordance with the same criteria as the employer
offers such benefits to U.S. workers);
(3) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the
place of employment;
(4) The employer has provided and will provide notice of the filing of the labor condition application to:
(i)(A) The bargaining representative of the employer's employees in the occupational classification in the area
of intended employment for which the H-1B nonimmigrants are sought, in the manner described in
§655.734(a)(1)(i); or
(B) If there is no such bargaining representative, affected workers by providing electronic notice of the filing
of the LCA or by posting notice in conspicuous locations at the place(s) of employment, in the manner described in
§655.734(a)(1)(ii); and
(ii) H-1B nonimmigrants by providing a copy of the LCA to each H-1B nonimmigrant at the time that such
nonimmigrant actually reports to work, in the manner described in §655.734(a)(2).
(5) For applications filed regarding H-1B nonimmigrants only (and not applications regarding H-1B1 or E-3
nonimmigrants), the employer has determined its status concerning H-1B-dependency and/or willful violator (as
described in §655.736), has indicated such status, and if either such status is applicable to the employer, has
indicated whether the LCA will be used only for exempt H-1B nonimmigrant(s), as described in §655.737.
(6) The employer has provided the information about the occupation required in paragraph (c) of this section.
(e) Change in employer's corporate structure or identity. (1) Where an employer corporation changes its
corporate structure as the result of an acquisition, merger, “spin-off,” or other such action, the new employing entity
is not required to file new LCAs and H-1B petitions with respect to the H-1B nonimmigrants transferred to the
employ of the new employing entity (regardless of whether there is a change in the Federal Employer Identification
Number (FEIN)), provided that the new employing entity maintains in its records a list of the H-1B nonimmigrants
transferred to the employ of the new employing entity, and maintains in the public access file(s) (see §655.760) a
document containing all of the following:

(i) Each affected LCA number and its date of certification;
(ii) A description of the new employing entity's actual wage system applicable to H-1B nonimmigrant(s) who
become employees of the new employing entity;
(iii) The Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) of the new employing entity (whether or not
different from that of the predecessor entity); and
(iv) A sworn statement by an authorized representative of the new employing entity expressly acknowledging
such entity's assumption of all obligations, liabilities and undertakings arising from or under attestations made in
each certified and still effective LCA filed by the predecessor entity. Unless such statement is executed and made
available in accordance with this paragraph, the new employing entity shall not employ any of the predecessor
entity's H-1B nonimmigrants without filing new LCAs and petitions for such nonimmigrants. The new employing
entity's statement shall include such entity's explicit agreement to:
(A) Abide by the DOL's H-1B regulations applicable to the LCAs;
(B) Maintain a copy of the statement in the public access file (see §655.760); and
(C) Make the document available to any member of the public or the Department upon request.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the new employing entity must file new
LCA(s) and H-1B petition(s) when it hires any new H-1B nonimmigrant(s) or seeks extension(s) of H-1B status for
existing H-1B nonimmigrant(s). In other words, the new employing entity may not utilize the predecessor entity's
LCA(s) to support the hiring or extension of any H-1B nonimmigrant after the change in corporate structure.
(3) A change in an employer's H-1B-dependency status which results from the change in the corporate
structure has no effect on the employer's obligations with respect to its current H-1B nonimmigrant employees.
However, the new employing entity shall comply with §655.736 concerning H-1B-dependency and/or willfulviolator status and §655.737 concerning exempt H-1B nonimmigrants, in the event that such entity seeks to hire new
H-1B nonimmigrant(s) or to extend the H-1B status of existing H-1B nonimmigrants. (See §655.736(d)(6).)

§655.731 What is the first LCA requirement, regarding wages?
An employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of
distinguished merit and ability shall state on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E that it will pay the H-1B nonimmigrant the
required wage rate. For the purposes of this section, “H-1B” includes “E-3 and H-1B1” as well.
(a) Establishing the wage requirement. The first LCA requirement shall be satisfied when the employer signs
Form ETA 9035 or 9035E attesting that, for the entire period of authorized employment, the required wage rate will
be paid to the H-1B nonimmigrant(s); that is, that the wage shall be the greater of the actual wage rate (as specified
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or the prevailing wage (as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The wage
requirement includes the employer's obligation to offer benefits and eligibility for benefits provided as compensation
for services to H-1B nonimmigrants on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer
offers to U.S. workers.
(1) The actual wage is the wage rate paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and
qualifications for the specific employment in question. In determining such wage level, the following factors may be
considered: Experience, qualifications, education, job responsibility and function, specialized knowledge, and other
legitimate business factors. “Legitimate business factors,” for purposes of this section, means those that it is

reasonable to conclude are necessary because they conform to recognized principles or can be demonstrated by
accepted rules and standards. Where there are other employees with substantially similar experience and
qualifications in the specific employment in question—i.e., they have substantially the same duties and
responsibilities as the H-1B nonimmigrant—the actual wage shall be the amount paid to these other employees.
Where no such other employees exist at the place of employment, the actual wage shall be the wage paid to the H1B nonimmigrant by the employer. Where the employer's pay system or scale provides for adjustments during the
period of the LCA—e.g., cost of living increases or other periodic adjustments, or the employee moves to a more
advanced level in the same occupation—such adjustments shall be provided to similarly employed H-1B
nonimmigrants (unless the prevailing wage is higher than the actual wage).
(2) The prevailing wage for the occupational classification in the area of intended employment must be
determined as of the time of filing the application. The employer shall base the prevailing wage on the best
information available as of the time of filing the application. Except as provided in this section, the employer is not
required to use any specific methodology to determine the prevailing wage and may utilize a wage obtained from an
OFLC NPC (OES), an independent authoritative source, or other legitimate sources of wage data. One of the
following sources shall be used to establish the prevailing wage:
(i) A collective bargaining agreement which was negotiated at arms-length between a union and the employer
which contains a wage rate applicable to the occupation;
(ii) If the job opportunity is in an occupation which is not covered by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the
prevailing wage shall be the arithmetic mean of the wages of workers similarly employed, except that the prevailing
wage shall be the median when provided by paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A), (b)(3)(iii)(B)(2), and (b)(3)(iii)(C)(2) of this
section. The prevailing wage rate shall be based on the best information available. The following prevailing wage
sources may be used:
(A) OFLC National Processing Center (NPC) determination. Prior to January 1, 2010, the SWA having
jurisdiction over the area of intended employment shall continue to receive and process prevailing wage
determination requests, but shall do so in accordance with these regulatory provisions and Department guidance. On
or after January 1, 2010, the NPC shall receive and process prevailing wage determination requests in accordance
with these regulations and with Department guidance. Upon receipt of a written request for a PWD on or after
January 1, 2010, the NPC will determine whether the occupation is covered by a collective bargaining agreement
which was negotiated at arms length, and, if not, determine the arithmetic mean of wages of workers similarly
employed in the area of intended employment. The wage component of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational
Employment Statistics survey shall be used to determine the arithmetic mean, unless the employer provides an
acceptable survey. The NPC shall determine the wage in accordance with secs. 212(n) and 212(t) of the INA. If an
acceptable employer-provided wage survey provides a median and does not provide an arithmetic mean, the median
shall be the prevailing wage applicable to the employer's job opportunity. In making a PWD, the Chicago NPC will
follow 20 CFR 656.40 and other administrative guidelines or regulations issued by ETA. The Chicago NPC shall
specify the validity period of the PWD, which in no event shall be for less than 90 days or more than 1 year from the
date of the determination.
(1) An employer who chooses to utilize an NPC PWD shall file the labor condition application within the
validity period of the prevailing wage as specified in the PWD. Any employer desiring review of an NPC PWD,
including judicial review, shall follow the appeal procedures at 20 CFR 656.41. Employers which challenge an NPC
PWD under 20 CFR 656.41 must obtain a ruling prior to filing an LCA. In any challenge, the Department and the
NPC shall not divulge any employer wage data collected under the promise of confidentiality. Once an employer
obtains a PWD from the NPC and files an LCA supported by that PWD, the employer is deemed to have accepted
the PWD (as to the amount of the wage) and thereafter may not contest the legitimacy of the PWD by filing an
appeal with the CO (see 20 CFR 656.41) or in an investigation or enforcement action.
(2) If the employer is unable to wait for the NPC to produce the requested prevailing wage for the occupation
in question, or for the CO and/or the BALCA to issue a decision, the employer may rely on other legitimate sources
of available wage information as set forth in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. If the employer later
discovers, upon receipt of the PWD from the NPC, that the information relied upon produced a wage below the final

PWD and the employer was paying the NPC-determined wage, no wage violation will be found if the employer
retroactively compensates the H-2B nonimmigrant(s) for the difference between wage paid and the prevailing wage,
within 30 days of the employer's receipt of the PWD.
(3) In all situations where the employer obtains the PWD from the NPC, the Department will deem that PWD
as correct as to the amount of the wage. Nevertheless, the employer must maintain a copy of the NPC PWD. A
complaint alleging inaccuracy of an NPC PWD, in such cases, will not be investigated.
(B) An independent authoritative source. The employer may use an independent authoritative wage source in
lieu of an NPC PWD. The independent authoritative source survey must meet all the criteria set forth in paragraph
(b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(C) Another legitimate source of wage information. The employer may rely on other legitimate sources of
wage data to obtain the prevailing wage. The other legitimate source survey must meet all the criteria set forth in
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. The employer will be required to demonstrate the legitimacy of the wage in
the event of an investigation.
(iii) For purposes of this section, “similarly employed” means “having substantially comparable jobs in the
occupational classification in the area of intended employment,” except that if a representative sample of workers in
the occupational category can not be obtained in the area of intended employment, “similarly employed” means:
(A) Having jobs requiring a substantially similar level of skills within the area of intended employment; or
(B) If there are no substantially comparable jobs in the area of intended employment, having substantially
comparable jobs with employers outside of the area of intended employment.
(iv) A prevailing wage determination for LCA purposes made pursuant to this section shall not permit an
employer to pay a wage lower than required under any other applicable Federal, state or local law.
(v) Where a range of wages is paid by the employer to individuals in an occupational classification or among
individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question, a range is considered
to meet the prevailing wage requirement so long as the bottom of the wage range is at least the prevailing wage rate.
(vi) The employer shall enter the prevailing wage on the LCA in the form in which the employer will pay the
wage (e.g., an annual salary or an hourly rate), except that in all cases the prevailing wage must be expressed as an
hourly wage if the H-1B nonimmigrant will be employed part-time. Where an employer obtains a prevailing wage
determination (from any of the sources identified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section) that is expressed as
an hourly rate, the employer may convert this determination to a yearly salary by multiplying the hourly rate by
2080. Conversely, where an employer obtains a prevailing wage (from any of these sources) that is expressed as a
yearly salary, the employer may convert this determination to an hourly rate by dividing the salary by 2080.
(vii) In computing the prevailing wage for a job opportunity in an occupational classification in an area of
intended employment in the case of an employee of an institution of higher education or an affiliated or related
nonprofit entity, a nonprofit research organization, or a Governmental research organization as these terms are
defined in 20 CFR 656.40(e), the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at such institutions
and organizations in the area of intended employment.
(viii) An employer may file more than one LCA for the same occupational classification in the same area of
employment and, in such circumstances, the employer could have H-1B employees in the same occupational
classification in the same area of employment, brought into the U.S. (or accorded H-1B status) based on petitions
approved pursuant to different LCAs (filed at different times) with different prevailing wage determinations.
Employers are advised that the prevailing wage rate as to any particular H-1B nonimmigrant is prescribed by the
LCA which supports that nonimmigrant's H-1B petition. The employer is required to obtain the prevailing wage at

the time that the LCA is filed (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The LCA is valid for the period certified by
ETA, and the employer must satisfy all the LCA's requirements (including the required wage which encompasses
both prevailing and actual wage rates) for as long as any H-1B nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to that LCA
(§655.750). Where new nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to a new LCA, that new LCA prescribes the
employer's obligations as to those new nonimmigrants. The prevailing wage determination on the later/subsequent
LCA does not “relate back” to operate as an “update” of the prevailing wage for the previously-filed LCA for the
same occupational classification in the same area of employment. However, employers are cautioned that the actual
wage component to the required wage may, as a practical matter, eliminate any wage-payment differentiation among
H-1B employees based on different prevailing wage rates stated in applicable LCAs. Every H-1B nonimmigrant is
to be paid in accordance with the employer's actual wage system, and thus is to receive any pay increases which that
system provides.
(3) Once the prevailing wage rate is established, the H-1B employer then shall compare this wage with the
actual wage rate for the specific employment in question at the place of employment and must pay the H-1B
nonimmigrant at least the higher of the two wages.
(b) Documentation of the wage statement. (1) The employer shall develop and maintain documentation
sufficient to meet its burden of proving the validity of the wage statement required in paragraph (a) of this section
and attested to on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E. The documentation shall be made available to DOL upon request.
Documentation shall also be made available for public examination to the extent required by §655.760. The
employer shall also document that the wage rate(s) paid to H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is(are) no less than the required
wage rate(s). The documentation shall include information about the employer's wage rate(s) for all other employees
for the specific employment in question at the place of employment, beginning with the date the labor condition
application was submitted and continuing throughout the period of employment. The records shall be retained for
the period of time specified in §655.760. The payroll records for each such employee shall include:
(i) Employee's full name;
(ii) Employee's home address;
(iii) Employee's occupation;
(iv) Employee's rate of pay;
(v) Hours worked each day and each week by the employee if:
(A) The employee is paid on other than a salary basis (e.g., hourly, piece-rate; commission); or
(B) With respect only to H-1B nonimmigrants, the worker is a part-time employee (whether paid a salary or an
hourly rate).
(vi) Total additions to or deductions from pay each pay period, by employee; and
(vii) Total wages paid each pay period, date of pay and pay period covered by the payment, by employee.
(viii) Documentation of offer of benefits and eligibility for benefits provided as compensation for services on
the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer offers to U.S. workers (see paragraph
(c)(3) of this section):
(A) A copy of any document(s) provided to employees describing the benefits that are offered to employees,
the eligibility and participation rules, how costs are shared, etc. (e.g., summary plan descriptions, employee
handbooks, any special or employee-specific notices that might be sent);

(B) A copy of all benefit plans or other documentation describing benefit plans and any rules the employer
may have for differentiating benefits among groups of workers;
(C) Evidence as to what benefits are actually provided to U.S. workers and H-1B nonimmigrants, including
evidence of the benefits selected or declined by employees where employees are given a choice of benefits;
(D) For multinational employers who choose to provide H-1B nonimmigrants with “home country” benefits,
evidence of the benefits provided to the nonimmigrant before and after he/she went to the United States. See
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(2) Actual wage. In addition to payroll data required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section (and also by the Fair
Labor Standards Act), the employer shall retain documentation specifying the basis it used to establish the actual
wage. The employer shall show how the wage set for the H-1B nonimmigrant relates to the wages paid by the
employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question
at the place of employment. Where adjustments are made in the employer's pay system or scale during the validity
period of the LCA, the employer shall retain documentation explaining the change and clearly showing that, after
such adjustments, the wages paid to the H-1B nonimmigrant are at least the greater of the adjusted actual wage or
the prevailing wage for the occupation and area of intended employment.
(3) Prevailing wage. The employer also shall retain documentation regarding its determination of the
prevailing wage. This source documentation shall not be submitted to ETA with the labor condition application, but
shall be retained at the employer's place of business for the length of time required in §655.760(c). Such
documentation shall consist of the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and the
documentation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(i) If the employer used a wage determination issued pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40
U.S.C. 276a et seq. (see 29 CFR part 1), or the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq. (see
29 CFR part 4), the documentation shall include a copy of the determination showing the wage rate for the
occupation in the area of intended employment.
(ii) If the employer used an applicable wage rate from a union contract which was negotiated at arms-length
between a union and the employer, the documentation shall include an excerpt from the union contract showing the
wage rate(s) for the occupation.
(iii) If the employer did not use a wage covered by the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this
section, the employer's documentation shall consist of:
(A) A copy of the prevailing wage finding from the NPC for the occupation within the area of intended
employment.
(B) A copy of the prevailing wage survey for the occupation within the area of intended employment
published by an independent authoritative source. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B), a prevailing wage
survey for the occupation in the area of intended employment published by an independent authoritative source shall
mean a survey of wages published in a book, newspaper, periodical, loose-leaf service, newsletter, or other similar
medium, within the 24-month period immediately preceding the filing of the employer's application. Such survey
shall:
(1) Reflect the weighted average wage paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended
employment;
(2) Reflect the median wage of workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment if the survey
provides such a median and does not provide a weighted average wage of workers similarly employed in the area of
intended employment;

(3) Be based upon recently collected data—e.g., within the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of
publication of the survey; and
(4) Represent the latest published prevailing wage finding by the independent authoritative source for the
occupation in the area of intended employment; or
(C) A copy of the prevailing wage survey or other source data acquired from another legitimate source of
wage information that was used to make the prevailing wage determination. For purposes of this paragraph
(b)(3)(iii)(C), a prevailing wage provided by another legitimate source of such wage information shall be one which:
(1) Reflects the weighted average wage paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended
employment;
(2) Reflect the median wage of workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment if the survey
provides such a median and does not provide a weighted average wage of workers similarly employed in the area of
intended employment;
(3) Is based on the most recent and accurate information available; and
(4) Is reasonable and consistent with recognized standards and principles in producing a prevailing wage.
(c) Satisfaction of required wage obligation. (1) The required wage must be paid to the employee, cash in
hand, free and clear, when due, except that deductions made in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section may
reduce the cash wage below the level of the required wage. Benefits and eligibility for benefits provided as
compensation for services must be offered in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2) “Cash wages paid,” for purposes of satisfying the H-1B required wage, shall consist only of those
payments that meet all the following criteria:
(i) Payments shown in the employer's payroll records as earnings for the employee, and disbursed to the
employee, cash in hand, free and clear, when due, except for deductions authorized by paragraph (c)(9) of this
section;
(ii) Payments reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as the employee's earnings, with appropriate
withholding for the employee's tax paid to the IRS (in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26
U.S.C. 1, et seq.);
(iii) Payments of the tax reported and paid to the IRS as required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act,
26 U.S.C. 3101, et seq. (FICA). The employer must be able to document that the payments have been so reported to
the IRS and that both the employer's and employee's taxes have been paid except that when the H-1B nonimmigrant
is a citizen of a foreign country with which the President of the United States has entered into an agreement as
authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 433 (i.e., an agreement establishing a totalization
arrangement between the social security system of the United States and that of the foreign country), the employer's
documentation shall show that all appropriate reports have been filed and taxes have been paid in the employee's
home country.
(iv) Payments reported, and so documented by the employer, as the employee's earnings, with appropriate
employer and employee taxes paid to all other appropriate Federal, State, and local governments in accordance with
any other applicable law.
(v) Future bonuses and similar compensation (i.e., unpaid but to-be-paid) may be credited toward satisfaction
of the required wage obligation if their payment is assured (i.e., they are not conditional or contingent on some event
such as the employer's annual profits). Once the bonuses or similar compensation are paid to the employee, they

must meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section (i.e., recorded and reported as
“earnings” with appropriate taxes and FICA contributions withheld and paid).
(3) Benefits and eligibility for benefits provided as compensation for services (e.g., cash bonuses; stock
options; paid vacations and holidays; health, life, disability and other insurance plans; retirement and savings plans)
shall be offered to the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the
employer offers to U.S. workers.
(i) For purposes of this section, the offer of benefits “on the same basis, and in accordance with the same
criteria” means that the employer shall offer H-1B nonimmigrants the same benefit package as it offers to U.S.
workers, and may not provide more strict eligibility or participation requirements for the H-1B nonimmigrant(s)
than for similarly employed U.S. workers(s) (e.g., full-time workers compared to full-time workers; professional
staff compared to professional staff). H-1B nonimmigrants are not to be denied benefits on the basis that they are
“temporary employees” by virtue of their nonimmigrant status. An employer may offer greater or additional benefits
to the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) than are offered to similarly employed U.S. worker(s), provided that such differing
treatment is consistent with the requirements of all applicable nondiscrimination laws (e.g., Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2000e17). Offers of benefits by employers shall be made in good faith and shall
result in the H-1B nonimmigrant(s)'s actual receipt of the benefits that are offered by the employer and elected by
the H-1B nonimmigrant(s).
(ii) The benefits received by the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) need not be identical to the benefits received by
similarly employed U.S. workers(s), provided that the H-1B nonimmigrant is offered the same benefits package as
those workers but voluntarily chooses to receive different benefits (e.g., elects to receive cash payment rather than
stock option, elects not to receive health insurance because of required employee contributions, or elects to receive
different benefits among an array of benefits) or, in those instances where the employer is part of a multinational
corporate operation, the benefits received by the H-1B nonimmigrant are provided in accordance with an employer's
practice that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section. In all cases, however, an
employer's practice must comply with the requirements of any applicable nondiscrimination laws (e.g., Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2000e17).
(iii) If the employer is part of a multinational corporate operation (i.e., operates in affiliation with business
entities in other countries, whether as subsidiaries or in some other arrangement), the following three options (i.e.,
(A), (B) or (C)) are available to the employer with respect to H-1B nonimmigrants who remain on the “home
country” payroll.
(A) The employer may offer the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) benefits in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and
(ii) of this section.
(B) Where an H-1B nonimmigrant is in the U.S. for no more than 90 consecutive calendar days, the employer
during that period may maintain the H-1B nonimmigrant on the benefits provided to the nonimmigrant in his/her
permanent work station (ordinarily the home country), and not offer the nonimmigrant the benefits that are offered
to similarly employed U.S. workers, provided that the employer affords reciprocal benefits treatment for any U.S.
workers (i.e., allows its U.S. employees, while working out of the country on a temporary basis away from their
permanent work stations in the United States, or while working in the United States on a temporary basis away from
their permanent work stations in another country, to continue to receive the benefits provided them at their
permanent work stations). Employers are cautioned that this provision is available only if the employer's practices
do not constitute an evasion of the benefit requirements, such as where the H-1B nonimmigrant remains in the
United States for most of the year, but briefly returns to the “home country” before any 90-day period would expire.
(C) Where an H-1B nonimmigrant is in the U.S. for more than 90 consecutive calendar days (or from the point
where the worker is transferred to the U.S. or it is anticipated that the worker will likely remain in the U.S. more
than 90 consecutive days), the employer may maintain the H-1B nonimmigrant on the benefits provided in his/her
home country (i.e., “home country benefits”) (and not offer the nonimmigrant the benefits that are offered to
similarly employed U.S. workers) provided that all of the following criteria are satisfied:

(1) The H-1B nonimmigrant continues to be employed in his/her home country (either with the H-1B
employer or with a corporate affiliate of the employer);
(2) The H-1B nonimmigrant is enrolled in benefits in his/her home country (in accordance with any applicable
eligibility standards for such benefits);
(3) The benefits provided in his/her home country are equivalent to, or equitably comparable to, the benefits
offered to similarly employed U.S. workers (i.e., are no less advantageous to the nonimmigrant);
(4) The employer affords reciprocal benefits treatment for any U.S. workers while they are working out of the
country, away from their permanent work stations (whether in the United States or abroad), on a temporary basis
(i.e., maintains such U.S. workers on the benefits they received at their permanent work stations);
(5) If the employer offers health benefits to its U.S. workers, the employer offers the same plan on the same
basis to its H-1B nonimmigrants in the United States where the employer does not provide the H-1B nonimmigrant
with health benefits in the home country, or the employer's home-country health plan does not provide full coverage
(i.e., coverage comparable to what he/she would receive at the home work station) for medical treatment in the
United States; and
(6) The employer offers H-1B nonimmigrants who are in the United States more than 90 continuous days
those U.S. benefits which are paid directly to the worker (e.g., paid vacation, paid holidays, and bonuses).
(iv) Benefits provided as compensation for services may be credited toward the satisfaction of the employer's
required wage obligation only if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met (e.g., recorded and
reported as “earnings” with appropriate taxes and FICA contributions withheld and paid).
(4) For salaried employees, wages will be due in prorated installments (e.g., annual salary divided into 26 biweekly pay periods, where employer pays bi-weekly) paid no less often than monthly except that, in the event that
the employer intends to use some other form of nondiscretionary payment to supplement the employee's regular/prorata pay in order to meet the required wage obligation (e.g., a quarterly production bonus), the employer's
documentation of wage payments (including such supplemental payments) must show the employer's commitment
to make such payment and the method of determining the amount thereof, and must show unequivocally that the
required wage obligation was met for prior pay periods and, upon payment and distribution of such other payments
that are pending, will be met for each current or future pay period. An employer that is a school or other educational
institution may apply an established salary practice under which the employer pays to H-1B nonimmigrants and U.S.
workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months,
provided that the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary payments prior to the commencement of the
employment and the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant does not otherwise cause him/her to
violate any condition of his/her authorization under the INA to remain in the U.S.
(5) For hourly-wage employees, the required wages will be due for all hours worked and/or for any
nonproductive time (as specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section) at the end of the employee's ordinary pay period
(e.g., weekly) but in no event less frequently than monthly.
(6) Subject to the standards specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section (regarding nonproductive status), an
H-1B nonimmigrant shall receive the required pay beginning on the date when the nonimmigrant “enters into
employment” with the employer.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), the H-1B nonimmigrant is considered to “enter into employment”
when he/she first makes him/herself available for work or otherwise comes under the control of the employer, such
as by waiting for an assignment, reporting for orientation or training, going to an interview or meeting with a
customer, or studying for a licensing examination, and includes all activities thereafter.

(ii) Even if the H-1B nonimmigrant has not yet “entered into employment” with the employer (as described in
paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section), the employer that has had an LCA certified and an H-1B petition approved for
the H-1B nonimmigrant shall pay the nonimmigrant the required wage beginning 30 days after the date the
nonimmigrant first is admitted into the U.S. pursuant to the petition, or, if the nonimmigrant is present in the United
States on the date of the approval of the petition, beginning 60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes
eligible to work for the employer. For purposes of this latter requirement, the H-1B nonimmigrant is considered to
be eligible to work for the employer upon the date of need set forth on the approved H-1B petition filed by the
employer, or the date of adjustment of the nonimmigrant's status by DHS, whichever is later. Matters such as the
worker's obtaining a State license would not be relevant to this determination.
(7) Wage obligation(s) for H-1B nonimmigrant in nonproductive status—(i) Circumstances where wages must
be paid. If the H-1B nonimmigrant is not performing work and is in a nonproductive status due to a decision by the
employer (e.g., because of lack of assigned work), lack of a permit or license, or any other reason except as specified
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the employer is required to pay the salaried employee the full pro-rata amount
due, or to pay the hourly-wage employee for a full-time week (40 hours or such other number of hours as the
employer can demonstrate to be full-time employment for hourly employees, or the full amount of the weekly salary
for salaried employees) at the required wage for the occupation listed on the LCA. If the employer's LCA carries a
designation of “part-time employment,” the employer is required to pay the nonproductive employee for at least the
number of hours indicated on the I-129 petition filed by the employer with the DHS and incorporated by reference
on the LCA. If the I-129 indicates a range of hours for part-time employment, the employer is required to pay the
nonproductive employee for at least the average number of hours normally worked by the H-1B nonimmigrant,
provided that such average is within the range indicated; in no event shall the employee be paid for fewer than the
minimum number of hours indicated for the range of part-time employment. In all cases the H-1B nonimmigrant
must be paid the required wage for all hours performing work within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.
(ii) Circumstances where wages need not be paid. If an H-1B nonimmigrant experiences a period of
nonproductive status due to conditions unrelated to employment which take the nonimmigrant away from his/her
duties at his/her voluntary request and convenience (e.g., touring the U.S., caring for ill relative) or render the
nonimmigrant unable to work (e.g., maternity leave, automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the
nonimmigrant), then the employer shall not be obligated to pay the required wage rate during that period, provided
that such period is not subject to payment under the employer's benefit plan or other statutes such as the Family and
Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).
Payment need not be made if there has been a bona fide termination of the employment relationship. DHS
regulations require the employer to notify the DHS that the employment relationship has been terminated so that the
petition is canceled (8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)), and require the employer to provide the employee with payment for
transportation home under certain circumstances (8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(E)).
(8) If the employee works in an occupation other than that identified on the employer's LCA, the employer's
required wage obligation is based on the occupation identified on the LCA, and not on whatever wage standards
may be applicable in the occupation in which the employee may be working.
(9) “Authorized deductions,” for purposes of the employer's satisfaction of the H-1B required wage obligation,
means a deduction from wages in complete compliance with one of the following three sets of criteria (i.e.,
paragraph (c)(9)(i), (ii), or (iii))—
(i) Deduction which is required by law (e.g., income tax; FICA); or
(ii) Deduction which is authorized by a collective bargaining agreement, or is reasonable and customary in the
occupation and/or area of employment (e.g., union dues; contribution to premium for health insurance policy
covering all employees; savings or retirement fund contribution for plan(s) in compliance with the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.), except that the deduction may not recoup a business
expense(s) of the employer (including attorney fees and other costs connected to the performance of H-1B program
functions which are required to be performed by the employer, e.g., preparation and filing of LCA and H-1B
petition); the deduction must have been revealed to the worker prior to the commencement of employment and, if

the deduction was a condition of employment, had been clearly identified as such; and the deduction must be made
against wages of U.S. workers as well as H-1B nonimmigrants (where there are U.S. workers); or
(iii) Deduction which meets the following requirements:
(A) Is made in accordance with a voluntary, written authorization by the employee (Note to paragraph
(c)(9)(iii)(A): an employee's mere acceptance of a job which carries a deduction as a condition of employment does
not constitute voluntary authorization, even if such condition were stated in writing);
(B) Is for a matter principally for the benefit of the employee (Note to paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B): housing and
food allowances would be considered to meet this “benefit of employee” standard, unless the employee is in travel
status, or unless the circumstances indicate that the arrangements for the employee's housing or food are principally
for the convenience or benefit of the employer (e.g., employee living at worksite in “on call” status));
(C) Is not a recoupment of the employer's business expense (e.g., tools and equipment; transportation costs
where such transportation is an incident of, and necessary to, the employment; living expenses when the employee is
traveling on the employer's business; attorney fees and other costs connected to the performance of H-1B program
functions which are required to be performed by the employer (e.g., preparation and filing of LCA and H-1B
petition)). (For purposes of this section, initial transportation from, and end-of-employment travel, to the worker's
home country shall not be considered a business expense.);
(D) Is an amount that does not exceed the fair market value or the actual cost (whichever is lower) of the
matter covered (Note to paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(D): The employer must document the cost and value); and
(E) Is an amount that does not exceed the limits set for garnishment of wages in the Consumer Credit
Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1673, and the regulations of the Secretary pursuant to that Act, 29 CFR part 870, under
which garnishment(s) may not exceed 25 percent of an employee's disposable earnings for a workweek.
(10) A deduction from or reduction in the payment of the required wage is not authorized (and is therefore
prohibited) for the following purposes (i.e., paragraphs (c)(10) (i) and (ii)):
(i) A penalty paid by the H-1B nonimmigrant for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date agreed
to by the nonimmigrant and the employer.
(A) The employer is not permitted to require (directly or indirectly) that the nonimmigrant pay a penalty for
ceasing employment with the employer prior to an agreed date. Therefore, the employer shall not make any
deduction from or reduction in the payment of the required wage to collect such a penalty.
(B) The employer is permitted to receive bona fide liquidated damages from the H-1B nonimmigrant who
ceases employment with the employer prior to an agreed date. However, the requirements of paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of
this section must be fully satisfied, if such damages are to be received by the employer via deduction from or
reduction in the payment of the required wage.
(C) The distinction between liquidated damages (which are permissible) and a penalty (which is prohibited) is
to be made on the basis of the applicable State law. In general, the laws of the various States recognize that
liquidated damages are amounts which are fixed or stipulated by the parties at the inception of the contract, and
which are reasonable approximations or estimates of the anticipated or actual damage caused to one party by the
other party's breach of the contract. On the other hand, the laws of the various States, in general, consider that
penalties are amounts which (although fixed or stipulated in the contract by the parties) are not reasonable
approximations or estimates of such damage. The laws of the various States, in general, require that the relation or
circumstances of the parties, and the purpose(s) of the agreement, are to be taken into account, so that, for example,
an agreement to a payment would be considered to be a prohibited penalty where it is the result of fraud or where it
cloaks oppression. Furthermore, as a general matter, the sum stipulated must take into account whether the contract

breach is total or partial (i.e., the percentage of the employment contract completed). (See, e.g., Vanderbilt
University v. DiNardo, 174 F.3d 751 (6th Cir. 1999) (applying Tennessee law); Overholt Crop Insurance Service
Co. v. Travis, 941 F.2d 1361 (8th Cir. 1991) (applying Minnesota and South Dakota law); BDO Seidman v.
Hirshberg, 712 N.E.2d 1220 (N.Y. 1999); Guiliano v. Cleo, Inc., 995 S.W.2d 88 (Tenn. 1999); Wojtowicz v.
Greeley Anesthesia Services, P.C., 961 P.2d 520 (Colo.Ct.App. 1998); see generally, Restatement (Second)
Contracts §356 (comment b); 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages §§683, 686, 690, 693, 703). In an enforcement proceeding
under subpart I of this part, the Administrator shall determine, applying relevant State law (including consideration
where appropriate to actions by the employer, if any, contributing to the early cessation, such as the employer's
constructive discharge of the nonimmigrant or non-compliance with its obligations under the INA and its
regulations) whether the payment in question constitutes liquidated damages or a penalty. (Note to paragraph
(c)(10)(i)(C): The $500/$1,000 filing fee, if any, under section 214(c) of the INA can never be included in any
liquidated damages received by the employer. See paragraph (c)(10)(ii), which follows.)
(ii) A rebate of the $500/$1,000 filing fee paid by the employer, if any, under section 214(c) of the INA. The
employer may not receive, and the H-1B nonimmigrant may not pay, any part of the $500 additional filing fee (for a
petition filed prior to December 18, 2000) or $1,000 additional filing fee (for a petition filed on or subsequent to
December 18, 2000), whether directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily. Thus, no deduction from or
reduction in wages for purposes of a rebate of any part of this fee is permitted. Further, if liquidated damages are
received by the employer from the H-1B nonimmigrant upon the nonimmigrant's ceasing employment with the
employer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer, such liquidated damages shall not include
any part of the $500/$1,000 filing fee (see paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section). If the filing fee is paid by a third
party and the H-1B nonimmigrant reimburses all or part of the fee to such third party, the employer shall be
considered to be in violation of this prohibition since the employer would in such circumstances have been spared
the expense of the fee which the H-1B nonimmigrant paid.
(11) Any unauthorized deduction taken from wages is considered by the Department to be non-payment of
that amount of wages, and in the event of an investigation, will result in back wage assessment (plus civil money
penalties and/or disqualification from H-1B and other immigration programs, if willful).
(12) Where the employer depresses the employee's wages below the required wage by imposing on the
employee any of the employer's business expenses(s), the Department will consider the amount to be an
unauthorized deduction from wages even if the matter is not shown in the employer's payroll records as a deduction.
(13) Where the employer makes deduction(s) for repayment of loan(s) or wage advance(s) made to the
employee, the Department, in the event of an investigation, will require the employer to establish the legitimacy and
purpose(s) of the loan(s) or wage advance(s), with reference to the standards set out in paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this
section.
(d) Enforcement actions. (1) In the event that a complaint is filed pursuant to subpart I of this part, alleging a
failure to meet the “prevailing wage” condition or a material misrepresentation by the employer regarding the
payment of the required wage, or pursuant to such other basis for investigation as the Administrator may find, the
Administrator shall determine whether the employer has the documentation required in paragraph (b)(3)of this
section, and whether the documentation supports the employer's wage attestation. Where the documentation is either
nonexistent or is insufficient to determine the prevailing wage (e.g., does not meet the criteria specified in this
section, in which case the Administrator may find a violation of paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3), of this section); or
where, based on significant evidence regarding wages paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment,
the Administrator has reason to believe that the prevailing wage finding obtained from an independent authoritative
source or another legitimate source varies substantially from the wage prevailing for the occupation in the area of
intended employment; or where the employer has been unable to demonstrate that the prevailing wage determined
by another legitimate source is in accordance with the regulatory criteria, the Administrator may contact ETA,
which shall provide the Administrator with a prevailing wage determination, which the Administrator shall use as
the basis for determining violations and for computing back wages, if such wages are found to be owed. The 30-day
investigatory period shall be suspended while ETA makes the prevailing wage determination and, in the event that
the employer timely challenges the determination (see §655.731(d)(2)), shall be suspended until the challenge
process is completed and the Administrator's investigation can be resumed.

(2) In the event the Administrator obtains a prevailing wage from ETA pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this
section, and the employer desires review, including judicial review, the employer shall challenge the ETA prevailing
wage only by filing a request for review under §656.41 of this chapter within 30 days of the employer's receipt of
the PWD from the Administrator. If the request is timely filed, the decision of OFLC is suspended until the Center
Director issues a determination on the employer's appeal. If the employer desires review, including judicial review,
of the decision of the NPC Center Director, the employer shall make a request for review of the determination by the
Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) under §656.41(e) of this chapter within 30 days of the receipt
of the decision of the Center Director. If a request for review is timely filed with the BALCA, the determination by
the Center Director is suspended until the BALCA issues a determination on the employer's appeal. In any challenge
to the wage determination, neither ETA nor the NPC shall divulge any employer wage data collected under the
promise of confidentiality.
(i) Where an employer timely challenges an OFLC PWD obtained by the Administrator, the 30-day
investigative period shall be suspended until the employer obtains a final ruling. Upon such a final ruling, the
investigation and any subsequent enforcement proceeding shall continue, with the PWD as determined by the
BALCA serving as the conclusive determination for all purposes.
(ii) [Reserved]
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), OFLC may consult with the NPC to ascertain the prevailing wage
applicable under the circumstances of the particular complaint.

§655.732 What is the second LCA requirement, regarding working conditions?
An employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants in specialty occupations or as fashion models of
distinguished merit and ability shall state on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E that the employment of H-1B nonimmigrants
will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment.
For the purposes of this section, “H-1B” includes “E-3 and H-1B1” as well.
(a) Establishing the working conditions requirement. The second LCA requirement shall be satisfied when the
employer affords working conditions to its H-1B nonimmigrant employees on the same basis and in accordance with
the same criteria as it affords to its U.S. worker employees who are similarly employed, and without adverse effect
upon the working conditions of such U.S. worker employees. Working conditions include matters such as hours,
shifts, vacation periods, and benefits such as seniority-based preferences for training programs and work schedules.
The employer's obligation regarding working conditions shall extend for the longer of two periods: the validity
period of the certified LCA, or the period during which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is(are) employed by the
employer.
(b) Documentation of the working condition statement. In the event of an enforcement action pursuant to
subpart I of this part, the employer shall produce documentation to show that it has afforded its H-1B nonimmigrant
employees working conditions on the same basis and in accordance with the same criteria as it affords its U.S.
worker employees who are similarly employed.
[65 FR 80221, Dec. 20, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 63302, Dec. 5, 2001; 73 FR 19949, Apr. 11, 2008]

§655.733 What is the third LCA requirement, regarding strikes and lockouts?
An employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants shall state on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E that there is not
at that time a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place of
employment. A strike or lockout which occurs after the labor condition application is filed by the employer with

DOL is covered by DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17). For the purposes of this section, “H-1B” includes “E-3
and H-1B1” as well.
(a) Establishing the no strike or lockout requirement. The third labor condition application requirement shall
be satisfied when the employer signs the labor condition application attesting that, as of the date the application is
filed, the employer is not involved in a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute in the
occupational classification in the area of intended employment. Labor disputes for the purpose of this section relate
only to those disputes involving employees of the employer working at the place of employment in the occupational
classification named in the labor condition application. See also DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17) for effects
of strikes or lockouts in general on the H-1B nonimmigrant's employment.
(1) Strike or lockout subsequent to certification of labor condition application. In order to remain in
compliance with the no strike or lockout labor condition statement, if a strike or lockout of workers in the same
occupational classification as the H-1B nonimmigrant occurs at the place of employment during the validity of the
labor condition application, the employer, within three days of the occurrence of the strike or lockout, shall submit
to ETA, by U.S. mail, facsimile (FAX), or private carrier, written notice of the strike or lockout. Further, the
employer shall not place, assign, lease, or otherwise contract out an H-1B nonimmigrant, during the entire period of
the labor condition application's validity, to any place of employment where there is a strike or lockout in the course
of a labor dispute in the same occupational classification as the H-1B nonimmigrant. Finally, the employer shall not
use the labor condition application in support of any petition filings for H-1B nonimmigrants to work in such
occupational classification at such place of employment until ETA determines that the strike or lockout has ended.
(2) ETA notice to DHS. Upon receiving from an employer a notice described in paragraph (a)(1) of this
section, ETA shall examine the documentation, and may consult with the union at the employer's place of business
or other appropriate entities. If ETA determines that the strike or lockout is covered under DHS's “Effect of strike”
regulation for “H” visa holders, ETA shall certify to DHS, in the manner set forth in that regulation, that a strike or
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in the same occupational classification as the H-1B
nonimmigrant is in progress at the place of employment. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17).
(b) Documentation of the third labor condition statement. The employer need not develop nor maintain
documentation to substantiate the statement referenced in paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of an
investigation, however, the employer has the burden of proof to show that there was no strike or lockout in the
course of a labor dispute for the occupational classification in which an H-1B nonimmigrant is employed, either at
the time the application was filed or during the validity period of the LCA.
[59 FR 65659, 65676, Dec. 20, 1994 as amended at 66 FR 63302, Dec. 5, 2001; 73 FR 19949, Apr. 11, 2008]

§655.734 What is the fourth LCA requirement, regarding notice?
An employer seeking to employ H-1B nonimmigrants shall state on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E that the
employer has provided notice of the filing of the labor condition application to the bargaining representative of the
employer's employees in the occupational classification in which the H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed or are
intended to be employed in the area of intended employment, or, if there is no such bargaining representative, has
posted notice of filing in conspicuous locations in the employer's establishment(s) in the area of intended
employment, in the manner described in this section. For the purposes of this section, “H-1B” includes “E-3 and H1B1” as well.
(a) Establishing the notice requirement. The fourth labor condition application requirement shall be
established when the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section are met.
(1)(i) Where there is a collective bargaining representative for the occupational classification in which the H1B nonimmigrants will be employed, on or within 30 days before the date the labor condition application is filed
with ETA, the employer shall provide notice to the bargaining representative that a labor condition application is
being, or will be, filed with ETA. The notice shall identify the number of H-1B nonimmigrants the employer is

seeking to employ; the occupational classification in which the H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed; the wages
offered; the period of employment; and the location(s) at which the H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed. Notice
under this paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall include the following statement: “Complaints alleging misrepresentation of
material facts in the labor condition application and/or failure to comply with the terms of the labor condition
application may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.”
(ii) Where there is no collective bargaining representative, the employer shall, on or within 30 days before the
date the LCA is filed with ETA, provide a notice of the filing of the LCA. The notice shall indicate that H-1B
nonimmigrants are sought; the number of such nonimmigrants the employer is seeking; the occupational
classification; the wages offered; the period of employment; the location(s) at which the H-1B nonimmigrants will
be employed; and that the LCA is available for public inspection at the H-1B employer's principal place of business
in the U.S. or at the worksite. The notice shall also include the statement: “Complaints alleging misrepresentation of
material facts in the labor condition application and/or failure to comply with the terms of the labor condition
application may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.”
If the employer is an H-1B-dependent employer or a willful violator, and the LCA is not being used only for exempt
H-1B nonimmigrants, the notice shall also set forth the nondisplacement and recruitment obligations to which the
employer has attested, and shall include the following additional statement: “Complaints alleging failure to offer
employment to an equally or better qualified U.S. applicant or an employer's misrepresentation regarding such offers
of employment may be filed with the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office of Special Counsel for
Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530,
Telephone: 1 (800) 255-8155 (employers), 1 (800) 255-7688 (employees); Web address:
http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc.” The notice shall be provided in one of the two following manners:
(A) Hard copy notice, by posting a notice in at least two conspicuous locations at each place of employment
where any H-1B nonimmigrant will be employed (whether such place of employment is owned or operated by the
employer or by some other person or entity).
(1) The notice shall be of sufficient size and visibility, and shall be posted in two or more conspicuous places
so that workers in the occupational classification at the place(s) of employment can easily see and read the posted
notice(s).
(2) Appropriate locations for posting the notices include, but are not limited to, locations in the immediate
proximity of wage and hour notices required by 29 CFR 516.4 or occupational safety and health notices required by
29 CFR 1903.2(a).
(3) The notices shall be posted on or within 30 days before the date the labor condition application is filed and
shall remain posted for a total of 10 days.
(B) Electronic notice, by providing electronic notification to employees in the occupational classification
(including both employees of the H-1B employer and employees of another person or entity which owns or operates
the place of employment) for which H-1B nonimmigrants are sought, at each place of employment where any H-1B
nonimmigrant will be employed. Such notification shall be given on or within 30 days before the date the labor
condition application is filed, and shall be available to the affected employees for a total of 10 days, except that if
employees are provided individual, direct notice (as by e-mail), notification only need be given once during the
required time period. Notification shall be readily available to the affected employees. An employer may accomplish
this by any means it ordinarily uses to communicate with its workers about job vacancies or promotion
opportunities, including through its “home page” or “electronic bulletin board” to employees who have, as a
practical matter, direct access to these resources; or through e-mail or an actively circulated electronic message such
as the employer's newsletter. Where affected employees at the place of employment are not on the “intranet” which
provides direct access to the home page or other electronic site but do have computer access readily available, the
employer may provide notice to such workers by direct electronic communication such as e-mail (i.e., a single,
personal e-mail message to each such employee) or by arranging to have the notice appear for 10 days on an intranet
which includes the affected employees (e.g., contractor arranges to have notice on customer's intranet accessible to
affected employees). Where employees lack practical computer access, a hard copy must be posted in accordance
with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, or the employer may provide employees individual copies of the notice.

(2) Where the employer places any H-1B nonimmigrant(s) at one or more worksites not contemplated at the
time of filing the application, but which are within the area of intended employment listed on the LCA, the employer
is required to post electronic or hard-copy notice(s) at such worksite(s), in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section, on or before the date any H-1B nonimmigrant begins work.
(3) The employer shall, no later than the date the H-1B nonimmigrant reports to work at the place of
employment, provide the H-1B nonimmigrant with a copy of the LCA (Form ETA 9035, or Form ETA 9035E)
certified by ETA and signed by the employer (or by the employer's authorized agent or representative). Upon
request, the employer shall provide the H-1B nonimmigrant with a copy of the cover pages, Form ETA 9035CP.
(b) Documentation of the fourth labor condition statement. The employer shall develop and maintain
documentation sufficient to meet its burden of proving the validity of the statement referenced in paragraph (a) of
this section and attested to on Form ETA 9035 or 9035E. Such documentation shall include a copy of the dated
notice and the name and address of the collective bargaining representative to whom the notice was provided. Where
there is no collective bargaining representative, the employer shall note and retain the dates when, and locations
where, the notice was posted and shall retain a copy of the posted notice.
(c) Records retention; records availability. The employer's documentation shall not be submitted to ETA with
the labor condition application, but shall be retained for the period of time specified in §655.760(c) of this part. The
documentation shall be made available for public examination as required in §655.760(a) of this part, and shall be
made available to DOL upon request.

§655.735 What are the special provisions for short-term placement of H-1B nonimmigrants at place(s) of
employment outside the area(s) of intended employment listed on the LCA?
This section does not apply to E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants.
(a) Subject to the conditions specified in this section, an employer may make short-term placements or
assignments of H-1B nonimmigrant(s) at worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) in areas not listed on the employer's
approved LCA(s) without filing new labor condition application(s) for such area(s).
(b) The following conditions must be fully satisfied by an employer during all short-term placement(s) or
assignment(s) of H-1B nonimmigrant(s) at worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) in areas not listed on the
employer's approved LCA(s):
(1) The employer has fully satisfied the requirements of §§655.730 through 655.734 with regard to worksite(s)
located within the area(s) of intended employment listed on the employer's LCA(s).
(2) The employer shall not place, assign, lease, or otherwise contract out any H-1B nonimmigrant(s) to any
worksite where there is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the same occupational classification(s)
as that of the H-1B nonimmigrant(s).
(3) For every day the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is placed or assigned outside the area(s) of employment listed on
the approved LCA(s) for such worker(s), the employer shall:
(i) Continue to pay such worker(s) the required wage (based on the prevailing wage at such worker's(s')
permanent worksite, or the employer's actual wage, whichever is higher);
(ii) Pay such worker(s) the actual cost of lodging (for both workdays and non-workdays); and

(iii) Pay such worker(s) the actual cost of travel, meals and incidental or miscellaneous expenses (for both
workdays and non-workdays).
(c) An employer's short-term placement(s) or assignment(s) of H-1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) in an
area of employment not listed on the employer's approved LCA(s) shall not exceed a total of 30 workdays in a oneyear period for any H-1B nonimmigrant at any worksite or combination of worksites in the area, except that such
placement or assignment of an H-1B nonimmigrant may be for longer than 30 workdays but for no more than a total
of 60 workdays in a one-year period where the employer is able to show the following:
(1) The H-1B nonimmigrant continues to maintain an office or work station at his/her permanent worksite
(e.g., the worker has a dedicated workstation and telephone line(s) at the permanent worksite);
(2) The H-1B nonimmigrant spends a substantial amount of time at the permanent worksite in a one-year
period; and
(3) The H-1B nonimmigrant's U.S. residence or place of abode is located in the area of the permanent worksite
and not in the area of the short-term worksite(s) (e.g., the worker's personal mailing address; the worker's lease for
an apartment or other home; the worker's bank accounts; the worker's automobile driver's license; the residence of
the worker's dependents).
(d) For purposes of this section, the term workday shall mean any day on which an H-1B nonimmigrant
performs any work at any worksite(s) within the area of short-term placement or assignment. For example, three
workdays would be counted where a nonimmigrant works three non-consecutive days at three different worksites
(whether or not the employer owns or controls such worksite(s)), within the same area of employment. Further, for
purposes of this section, the term one-year period shall mean the calendar year (i.e., January 1 through December
31) or the employer's fiscal year, whichever the employer chooses.
(e) The employer may not make short-term placement(s) or assignment(s) of H-1B nonimmigrant(s) under this
section at worksite(s) in any area of employment for which the employer has a certified LCA for the occupational
classification. Further, an H-1B nonimmigrant entering the U.S. is required to be placed at a worksite in accordance
with the approved petition and supporting LCA; thus, the nonimmigrant's initial placement or assignment cannot be
a short-term placement under this section. In addition, the employer may not continuously rotate H-1B
nonimmigrants on short-term placement or assignment to an area of employment in a manner that would defeat the
purpose of the short-term placement option, which is to provide the employer with flexibility in assignments to
afford enough time to obtain an approved LCA for an area where it intends to have a continuing presence (e.g., an
employer may not rotate H-1B nonimmigrants to an area of employment for 20-day periods, with the result that
nonimmigrants are continuously or virtually continuously employed in the area of employment, in order to avoid
filing an LCA; such an employer would violate the short-term placement provisions).
(f) Once any H-1B nonimmigrant's short-term placement or assignment has reached the workday limit
specified in paragraph (c) of this section in an area of employment, the employer shall take one of the following
actions:
(1) File an LCA and obtain ETA certification, and thereafter place any H-1B nonimmigrant(s) in that
occupational classification at worksite(s) in that area pursuant to the LCA (i.e., the employer shall perform all
actions required in connection with such LCA, including determination of the prevailing wage and notice to
workers); or
(2) Immediately terminate the placement of any H-1B nonimmigrant(s) who reaches the workday limit in an
area of employment. No worker may exceed the workday limit within the one-year period specified in paragraph (d)
of this section, unless the employer first files an LCA for the occupational classification for the area of employment.
Employers are cautioned that if any worker exceeds the workday limit within the one-year period, then the employer
has violated the terms of its LCA(s) and the regulations in the subpart, and thereafter the short-term placement

option cannot be used by the employer for H-1B nonimmigrants in that occupational classification in that area of
employment.
(g) An employer is not required to use the short-term placement option provided by this section, but may
choose to make each placement or assignment of an H-1B nonimmigrant at worksite(s) in a new area of employment
pursuant to a new LCA for such area. Further, an employer which uses the short-term placement option is not
required to continue to use the option. Such an employer may, at any time during the period identified in paragraphs
(c) and (d) of this section, file an LCA for the new area of employment (performing all actions required in
connection with such LCA); upon certification of such LCA, the employer's obligation to comply with this section
concerning short-term placement shall terminate. (However, see §655.731(c)(9)(iii)(C) regarding payment of
business expenses for employee's travel on employer's business.)
[65 FR 80222, Dec. 20, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 19949, Apr. 11, 2008]

§655.736 What are H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators?
Two attestation obligations apply only to two types of employers: H-1B-dependent employers (as described in
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section) and employers found to have willfully violated their H-1B obligations
within a certain five-year period (as described in paragraph (f) of this section). These obligations apply only to
certain labor condition applications filed by such employers (as described in paragraph (g) of this section), and do
not apply to LCAs filed by such employers solely for the employment of “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants (as
described in paragraph (g) of this section and §655.737). These obligations require that such employers not displace
U.S. workers from jobs (as described in §655.738) and that such employers recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1B
nonimmigrants (as described in §655.739).
(a) What constitutes an “H-1B-dependent” employer? (1) “H-1B-dependent employer,” for purposes of THIS
subpart H and subpart I of this part, means an employer that meets one of the three following standards, which are
based on the ratio between the employer's total work force employed in the U.S. (including both U.S. workers and
H-1B nonimmigrants, and measured according to full-time equivalent employees) and the employer's H-1B
nonimmigrant employees (a “head count” including both full-time and part-time H-1B employees)—
(i)(A) The employer has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the U.S.; and
(B) Employs more than seven H-1B nonimmigrants;
(ii)(A) The employer has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in
the U.S.; and
(B) Employs more than 12 H-1B nonimmigrant; or
(iii)(A) The employer has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the U.S.; and
(B) Employs H-1B nonimmigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of such fulltime equivalent employees.
(2) “Full-time equivalent employees” (FTEs), for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section are to be
determined according to the following standards:
(i) The determination of FTEs is to include only persons employed by the employer (as defined in §655.715),
and does not include bona fide consultants and independent contractors. For purposes of this section, the Department
will accept the employer's designation of persons as “employees,” provided that such persons are consistently
treated as “employees” for all purposes including FICA, FLSA, etc.

(ii) The determination of FTEs is to be based on the following records:
(A) To determine the number of employees, the employer's quarterly tax statement (or similar document) is to
be used (assuming there is no issue as to whether all employees are listed on the tax statement); and
(B) To determine the number of hours of work by part-time employees, for purposes of aggregating such
employees to FTEs, the last payroll (or the payrolls over the previous quarter, if the last payroll is not representative)
is to be used, or where hours of work records are not maintained, other available information is to be used to make a
reasonable approximation of hours of work (such as a standard work schedule). (But see paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(1)
of this section regarding the determination of FTEs for part-time employees without a computation of the hours
worked by such employees.)
(iii) The FTEs employed by the employer means the total of the two numbers yielded by paragraphs
(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), which follow:
(A) The number of full-time employees. A full-time employee is one who works 40 or more hours per week,
unless the employer can show that less than 40 hours per week is full-time employment in its regular course of
business (however, in no event would less than 35 hours per week be considered to be full-time employment). Each
full-time employee equals one FTE (e.g., 50 full-time employees would yield 50 FTEs). (Note to paragraph
(a)(2)(iii)(A): An employee who commonly works more than the number of hours constituting full-time
employment cannot be counted as more than one FTE.); plus
(B) The part-time employees aggregated to a number of full-time equivalents, if the employer has part-time
employees. For purposes of this determination, a part-time employee is one who regularly works fewer than the
number of hours per week which constitutes full-time employment (e.g., employee regularly works 20 hours, where
full-time employment is 35 hours per week). The aggregation of part-time employees to FTEs may be performed by
either of the following methods (i.e., paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(1) or (2)):
(1) Each employee working fewer than full-time hours counted as one-half of an FTE, with the total rounded
to the next higher whole number (e.g., three employees working fewer than 35 hours per week, where full-time
employment is 35 hours, would yield two FTEs (i.e., 1.5 rounded to 2)); or
(2) The total number of hours worked by all part-time employees in the representative pay period, divided by
the number of hours per week that constitute full-time employment, with the quotient rounded to the nearest whole
number (e.g., 72 total hours of work by three part-time employees, divided by 40 (hours per week constituting fulltime employment), would yield two FTEs (i.e., 1.8 rounded to 2)).
(iv) Examples of determinations of FTEs: Employer A has 100 employees, 70 of whom are full-time (with
full-time employment shown to be 44 hours of work per week) and 30 of whom are part-time (with a total of 1004
hours of work by all 30 part-time employees during the representative pay period). Utilizing the method in
paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, this employer would have 85 FTEs: 70 FTEs for full-time employees, plus
15 FTEs for part-time employees (i.e., each of the 30 part-time employees counted as one-half of a full-time
employee, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section). (This employer would have 23 FTEs for parttime employees, if these FTEs were computed as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section: 1004 total
hours of work by part-time employees, divided by 44 (full-time employment), yielding 22.8, rounded to 23)).
Employer B has 100 employees, 80 of whom are full-time (with full-time employment shown to be 40 hours of
work per week) and 20 of whom are part-time (with a total of 630 hours of work by all 30 part-time employees
during the representative pay period). This employer would have 90 FTEs: 80 FTEs for full-time employees, plus 10
FTEs for part-time employees (i.e., each of the 20 part-time employees counted as one-half of a full-time employee,
as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section) (This employer would have 16 FTEs for part-time
employees, if these FTEs were computed as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section: 630 total hours
of work by part-time employees, divided by 40 (full-time employment), yielding 15.7, rounded to 16)).

(b) What constitutes an “employer” for purposes of determining H-1B-dependency status? Any group treated
as a single employer under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) at 26 U.S.C. 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) shall be treated as a
single employer for purposes of the determination of H-1B-dependency. Therefore, if an employer satisfies the
requirements of the IRC and relevant regulations with respect to the following groups of employees, those
employees will be treated as employees of a single employer for purposes of determining whether that employer is
an H-1B-dependent employer.
(1) Pursuant to section 414(b) of the IRC and related regulations, all employees “within a controlled group of
corporations” (within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the IRC, determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4)
and (e)(3)(C)), will be treated as employees of a single employer. A controlled group of corporations is a parentsubsidiary-controlled group, a brother-sister-controlled group, or a combined group. 26 U.S.C. 1563(a), 26 CFR
1.414(b)-1(a).
(i) A parent-subsidiary-controlled group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock
ownership with a common parent corporation where at least 80 percent of the stock (by voting rights or value) of
each subsidiary corporation is owned by one or more of the other corporations (either another subsidiary or the
parent corporation), and the common parent corporation owns at least 80 percent of the stock of at least one
subsidiary.
(ii) A brother-sister-controlled group is a group of corporations in which five or fewer persons (individuals,
estates, or trusts) own 80 percent or more of the stock of the corporations and certain other ownership criteria are
satisfied.
(iii) A combined group is a group of three or more corporations, each of which is a member of a parentsubsidiary controlled group or a brother-sister-controlled group and one of which is a common parent corporation of
a parent-subsidiary-controlled group and is also included in a brother-sister-controlled group.
(2) Pursuant to section 414(c) of the IRC and related regulations, all employees of trades or businesses
(whether or not incorporated) that are under common control are treated as employees of a single employer. 26
U.S.C. 414(c), 26 CFR 1.414(c)-2.
(i) Trades or businesses are under common control if they are included in:
(A) A parent-subsidiary group of trades or businesses;
(B) A brother-sister group of trades or businesses; or
(C) A combined group of trades or businesses.
(ii) Trades or businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, estates, trusts or corporations.
(iii) The standards for determining whether trades or businesses are under common control are similar to
standards that apply to controlled groups of corporations. However, pursuant to 26 CFR 1.414(c)-2(b)(2), ownership
of at least an 80 percent interest in the profits or capital interest of a partnership or the actuarial value of a trust or
estate constitutes a controlling interest in a trade or business.
(3) Pursuant to section 414(m) of the IRC and related regulations, all employees of the members of an
affiliated service group are treated as employees of a single employer. 26 U.S.C. 414(m).
(i) An affiliated service group is, generally, a group consisting of a service organization (the “first
organization”), such as a health care organization, a law firm or an accounting firm, and one or more of the
following:

(A) A second service organization that is a shareholder or partner in the first organization and that regularly
performs services for the first organization (or is regularly associated with the first organization in performing
services for third persons); or
(B) Any other organization if :
(1) A significant portion of the second organization's business is the performance of services for the first
organization (or an organization described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section or for both) of a type historically
performed in such service field by employees, and
(2) Ten percent or more of the interest in the second organization is held by persons who are highly
compensated employees of the first organization (or an organization described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section).
(ii) [Reserved]
(4) Section 414(o) of the IRC provides that the Department of the Treasury may issue regulations addressing
other business arrangements, including employee leasing, in which a group of employees are treated as employed by
the same employer. However, the Department of the Treasury has not issued any regulations under this provision.
Therefore, that section of the IRC will not be taken into account in determining what groups of employees are
considered employees of a single employer for purposes of H-1B dependency determinations, unless regulations are
issued by the Treasury Department during the period the dependency provisions of the ACWIA are effective.
(5) The definitions of “single employer” set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section are
established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in regulations located at 26 CFR 1.414(b)-1(a), (c)-2 and (m)-5.
Guidance on these definitions should be sought from those regulations or from the IRS.
(c) Which employers are required to make determinations of H-1B-dependency status? Every employer that
intends to file an LCA regarding H-1B nonimmigrants or to file H-1B petition(s) or request(s) for extension(s) of H1B status from January 19, 2001 through September 30, 2003, and after March 7, 2005, is required to determine
whether it is an H-1B-dependent employer or a willful violator which, except as provided in §655.737, will be
subject to the additional obligations for H-1B-dependent employers (see paragraph (g) of this section). No H-1Bdependent employer or willful violator may use an LCA filed before January 19, 2001, and during the period of
October 1, 2003 through March 7, 2005, to support a new H-1B petition or request for an extension of status.
Furthermore, on all H-1B LCAs filed from January 19, 2001 through September 30, 2003, and on or after March 8,
2005, an employer will be required to attest whether it is an H-1B-dependent employer or willful violator. An
employer that attests it is non-H-1B-dependent but does not meet the “snap shot” test set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of
this section shall make and document a full calculation of its status. However, as explained in paragraphs (c)(1) and
(2) of this section, which follow, most employers would not be required to make any calculations or to create any
documentation as to the determination of their H-1B status.
(1) Employers with readily apparent status concerning H-1B-dependency need not calculate that status. For
most employers, regardless of their size, H-1B-dependency status (i.e., H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent) is
readily apparent and would require no calculations, in that the ratio of H-1B employees to the total workforce is
obvious and can easily be compared to the definition of “H-1B-dependency” (see definition set out in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section).
For example: Employer A with 20 employees, only one of whom is an H-1B non-immigrant, would obviously not be H1B-dependent and would not need to make calculations to confirm that status. Employer B with 45 employees, 30 of whom are
H-1B nonimmigrants, would obviously be H-1B-dependent and would not need to make calculations. Employer C with 500
employees, only 30 of whom are H-1B nonimmigrants, would obviously not be H-1B-dependent and would not need to make
calculations. Employer D with 1,000 employees, 850 of whom are H-1B nonimmigrants, would obviously be H-1B-dependent
and would not have to make calculations.

(2) Employers with borderline H-1B-dependency status may use a “snap-shot” test to determine whether
calculation of that status is necessary. Where an employer's H-1B-dependency status (i.e., H-1B-dependent or nonH-1B-dependent) is not readily apparent, the employer may use one of the following tests to determine whether a
full calculation of the status is needed:
(i) Small employer (50 or fewer employees). If the employer has 50 or fewer employees (both full-time and
part-time, including H-1B nonimmigrants and U.S. workers), then the employer may compare the number of its H1B nonimmigrant employees (both full-time and part-time) to the numbers specified in the definition set out in
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and shall fully calculate its H-1B-dependency status (i.e., calculate FTEs) where the
number of its H-1B nonimmigrant employees is above the number specified in the definition. In other words, if the
employer has 25 or fewer employees, and more than seven of them are H-1B nonimmigrants, then the employer
shall fully calculate its status; if the employer has at least 26 but no more than 50 employees, and more than 12 of
them are H-1B nonimmigrants, then the employer shall fully calculate its status.
(ii) Large employer (51 or more employees). If the number of H-1B nonimmigrant employees (both full-time
and part-time), divided by the number of full-time employees (including H-1B nonimmigrants and U.S. workers), is
0.15 or more, then an employer which believes itself to be non-H-1B-dependent shall fully calculate its H-1Bdependency status (including the calculation of FTEs). In other words, if the number of full-time employees
(including H-1B nonimmigrants and U.S. workers) multiplied by 0.15 yields a number that is equal to or less than
the number of H-1B nonimmigrant employees (both full-time and part-time), then the employer shall attest that it is
H-1B-dependent or shall fully calculate its H-1B dependency status (including the calculation of FTEs).
(d) What documentation is the employer required to make or maintain, concerning its determination of H-1Bdependency status? All employers are required to retain copies of H-1B petitions and requests for extensions of H1B status filed with the DHS, as well as the payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1). The nature of any
additional documentation would depend upon the general characteristics of the employer's workforce, as described
in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4), which follow.
(1) Employer with readily apparent status concerning H-1B-dependency. If an employer's H-1B-dependency
status (i.e., H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent) is readily apparent (as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section), then that status must be reflected on the employer's LCA but the employer is not required to make or
maintain any particular documentation. The public access file maintained in accordance with §655.760 would show
the H-1B-dependency status, by means of copy(ies) of the LCA(s). In the event of an enforcement action pursuant to
subpart I of this part, the employer's readily apparent status could be verified through records to be made available to
the Administrator (e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)).
(2) Employer with borderline H-1B-dependency status. An employer which uses a “snap-shot” test to
determine whether it should undertake a calculation of its H-1B-dependency status (as described in paragraph (c)(2)
of this section) is not required to make or maintain any documentation of that “snap-shot” test. The employer's status
must be reflected on the LCA(s), which would be available in the public access file. In the event of an enforcement
action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's records to be made available to the Administrator would
enable the employer to show and the Administrator to verify the “snap-shot” test (e.g., copies of H-1B petitions;
payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)) .
(3) Employer with H-1B-dependent status. An employer which attests that it is H-1B-dependent—whether that
status is readily apparent or is determined through calculations—is not required to make or maintain any
documentation of the calculation. The employer's status must be reflected on the LCA(s), which would be available
in the public access file. In the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's
designation of H-1B-dependent status on the LCA(s) would be conclusive and sufficient documentation of that
status (except where the employer's status had altered to non-H-1B-dependent and had been appropriately
documented, as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section).
(4) Employer with non-H-1B-dependent status who is required to perform full calculation. An employer which
attests that it is non-H-1B-dependent and does not meet the “snap shot” test set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this

section shall retain in its records a dated copy of its calculation that it is not H-1B-dependent. In the event of an
enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's records to be made available to the
Administrator would enable the employer to show and the Administrator to verify the employer's determination
(e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)).
(5) Employer which changes its H-1B-dependency status due to changes in workforce. An employer may
experience a change in its H-1B-dependency status, due to changes in the ratio of H-1B nonimmigrant to U.S.
workers in its workforce. Thus it is important that employers who wish to file a new LCA or a new H-1B petition or
request for extension of status remain cognizant of their dependency status and do a recheck of such status if the
make-up of their workforce changes sufficiently that their dependency status might possibly change. In the event of
such a change of status, the following standards will apply:
(i) Change from non-H-1B-dependent to H-1B-dependent. An employer which experiences this change in its
workforce is not required to make or maintain any record of its determination of the change of its H-1B-dependency
status. The employer is not required to file new LCA(s) (which would accurately state its H-1B-dependent status),
unless it seeks to hire new H-1B nonimmigrants or extend the status of existing H-1B nonimmigrants (see paragraph
(g) of this section).
(ii) Change from H-1B-dependent to non-H-1B-dependent. An employer which experiences this change in its
workforce is required to perform a full calculation of its status (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) and to
retain a copy of such calculation in its records. If the employer seeks to hire new H-1B nonimmigrants or extend the
status of existing H-1B nonimmigrants (see paragraph (g) of this section), the employer shall either file new LCAs
reflecting its non-H-1B-dependent status or use its existing certified LCAs reflecting an H-1B-dependency status, in
which case it shall continue to be bound by the dependent-employer attestations on such LCAs. In the event of an
enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's records to be made available to the
Administrator would enable the employer to show and the Administrator to verify the employer's determination
(e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)).
(6) Change in corporate structure or identity of employer. If an employer which experiences a change in its
corporate structure as the result of an acquisition, merger, “spin-off,” or other such action wishes to file a new LCA
or a new H-1B petition or request for extension of status, the new employing entity shall redetermine its H-1Bdependency status in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section (see paragraph (g) of this section). (See
§655.730(e), regarding change in corporate structure or identity of employer.) In the event of an enforcement action
pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's calculations where required under paragraph (c) of this section and
its records to be made available to the Administrator would enable the employer to show and the Administrator to
verify the employer's determination (e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)).
(7) “Single employer” under IRC test. If an employer utilizes the IRC single-employer definition and
concludes that it is non-H-1B-dependent, the employer shall perform the “snap-shot” test set forth in paragraph
(c)(2) of this section, and if it fails to meet that test, shall attest that it is H-1B-dependent or shall perform the full
calculation of dependency status in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The employer shall place a list of
the entities included as a “single employer” in the public access file maintained in accordance with §766.760. In
addition, the employer shall retain in its records the “snap-shot” or full calculation of its status, as appropriate
(showing the number of employees of each entity who are included in the numerator and denominator of the
equation, whether the employer utilizes the “snap shot” test or a complete calculation as described in paragraph (c)
of this section). In the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's records to be
made available to the Administrator would enable the employer to show and the Administrator to verify the
employer's determination (e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in §655.731(b)(1)).
(e) How is an employer's H-1B-dependency status to be shown on the LCA? The employer is required to
designate its status by marking the appropriate box on the Form ETA-9035 or 9035E (i.e., either H-1B-dependent or
non-H-1B-dependent). An employer which marks the designation of “H-1B-dependent” may also mark the
designation of its intention to seek only “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants on the LCA (see paragraph (g) of this
section, and §655.737). In the event that an employer has filed an LCA designating its H-1B-dependency status
(either H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent) and thereafter experiences a change of status, the employer cannot

use that LCA to support H-1B petitions for new nonimmigrants or requests for extension of H-1B status for existing
nonimmigrants. Similarly, an employer that is or becomes H-1B-dependent cannot continue to use an LCA filed
before January 19, 2001 to support new H-1B petitions or requests for extension of status. In such circumstances, the
employer shall file a new LCA accurately designating its status and shall use that new LCA to support new petitions
or requests for extensions of status.
(f) What constitutes a “willful violator” employer and what are its special obligations?
(1) “Willful violator” or “willful violator employer,” for purposes of this subpart H and subpart I of this part
means an employer that meets all of the following standards (i.e., paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii))—
(i) A finding of violation by the employer (as described in paragraph (f)(1) (ii)) is entered in either of the
following two types of enforcement proceeding:
(A) A Department of Labor proceeding under section 212(n)(2) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(C) and
subpart I of this part; or
(B) A Department of Justice proceeding under section 212(n)(5) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(5).
(ii) The agency finds that the employer has committed either a willful failure or a misrepresentation of a
material fact during the five-year period preceding the filing of the LCA; and
(iii) The agency's finding is entered on or after October 21, 1998.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, “willful failure” means a violation which is a “willful failure” as defined in
§655.805(c).
(g) What LCAs are subject to the additional attestation obligations? (1) An employer that is “H-1Bdependent” (under the standards described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section) or is a “willful violator”
(under the standards described in paragraph (f) of this section) is subject to the attestation obligations regarding
displacement of U.S. workers and recruitment of U.S. workers (under the standards described in §§655.738 and
655.739, respectively) for all LCAs that are filed during the time period specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section,
to be used to support any petitions for new H-1B nonimmigrants or any requests for extensions of status for existing
H-1B nonimmigrants. An LCA which does not accurately indicate the employer's H-1B-dependency status or willful
violator status shall not be used to support H-1B petitions or requests for extensions. Further, an employer which
falsely attests to non-H-1B-dependency status, or which experiences a change of status to H-1B-dependency but
continues to use the LCA to support new H-1B petitions or requests for extension of status shall—despite the LCA
designation of non-H-1B-dependency—be held to its obligations to comply with the attestation requirements
concerning nondisplacement of U.S. workers and recruitment of U.S. workers (as described in §§655.738 and
655.739, respectively), as explicitly acknowledged and agreed on the LCA.
(2) During the period between January 19, 2001 through September 30, 2003, and on or after March 8, 2005,
any employer that is “H-1B-dependent” (under the standards described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section)
or is a “willful violator” (under the standards described in paragraph (f) of this section) shall file a new LCA
accurately indicating that status in order to be able to file petition(s) for new H-1B nonimmigrant(s) or request(s) for
extension(s) of status for existing H-1B nonimmigrant(s). An LCA filed during a period when the special attestation
obligations for H-1B dependent employers and willful violators were not in effect (that is before January 19, 2001,
and from October 1, 2003 through March 7, 2005) may not be used by an H-1B dependent employer or willful
violator to support petition(s) for new H-1B nonimmigrant(s) or request(s) for extension(s) of status for existing H1B nonimmigrants.
(3) An employer that files an LCA indicating “H-1B-dependent” and/or “willful violator” status may also
indicate on the LCA that all the H-1B nonimmigrants to be employed pursuant to that LCA will be “exempt H-1B

nonimmigrants” as described in §655.737. Such an LCA is not subject to the additional LCA attestation obligations,
provided that all H-1B nonimmigrants employed under it are, in fact, exempt. An LCA which indicates that it will
be used only for exempt H-1B nonimmigrants shall not be used to support H-1B petitions or requests for extensions
of status for H-1B nonimmigrants who are not, in fact, exempt. Further, an employer which attests that the LCA will
be used only for exempt H-1B nonimmigrants but uses the LCA to employ non-exempt H-1B nonimmigrants
(through petitions and/or extensions of status) shall—despite the LCA designation of exempt H-1B
nonimmigrants—be held to its obligations to comply with the attestation requirements concerning nondisplacement
of U.S. workers and recruitment of U.S. workers (as described in §§655.738 and 655.739, respectively), as explicitly
acknowledged and agreed on the LCA.
(4) The special provisions for H-1B-dependent employers and willful violator employers do not apply to
LCAs filed from October 1, 2003 through March 7, 2005, or before January 19, 2001. However, all LCAs filed
before October 1, 2003, and containing the additional attestation obligations described in this section and §§655.737
through 655.739, will remain in effect with regard to those obligations, for so long as any H-1B nonimmigrant(s)
employed pursuant to the LCA(s) remain employed by the employer.
[65 FR 80223, Dec. 20, 2000; 66 FR 1375, Jan. 8, 2001, as amended at 66 FR 63302, Dec. 5, 2001; 70 FR 72563, Dec. 5, 2005]

§655.737 What are “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants, and how does their employment affect the additional
attestation obligations of H-1B-dependent employers and willful violator employers?
(a) An employer that is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator of the H-1B program requirements (as described
in §655.736) is subject to the attestation obligations regarding displacement of U.S. workers and recruitment of U.S.
workers (as described in §§655.738 and 655.739, respectively) for all LCAs that are filed during the time period
specified in §655.736(g). However, these additional obligations do not apply to an LCA filed by such an employer if
the LCA is used only for the employment of “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants (through petitions and/or extensions of
status) as described in this section.
(b) What is the test or standard for determining an H-1B nonimmigrant's “exempt” status? An H-1B
nonimmigrant is “exempt” for purposes of this section if the nonimmigrant meets either of the two following
criteria:
(1) Receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least
$60,000; or
(2) Has attained a master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended
employment.
(c) How is the $60,000 annual wage to be determined? The H-1B nonimmigrant can be considered to be an
“exempt” worker, for purposes of this section, if the nonimmigrant actually receives hourly wages or annual salary
totaling at least $60,000 in the calendar year. The standards applicable to the employer's satisfaction of the required
wage obligation are applicable to the determination of whether the $60,000 wages or salary are received (see
§655.731(c)(2) and (3)). Thus, employer contributions or costs for benefits such as health insurance, life insurance,
and pension plans cannot be counted toward this $60,000. The compensation to be counted or credited for these
purposes could include cash bonuses and similar payments, provided that such compensation is paid to the worker
“cash in hand, free and clear, when due” (§655.731(c)(1)), meaning that the compensation has readily determinable
market value, is readily convertible to cash tender, and is actually received by the employee when due (which must
be within the year for which the employer seeks to count or credit the compensation toward the employee's $60,000
earnings to qualify for exempt status). Cash bonuses and similar compensation can be counted or credited toward the
$60,000 for “exempt” status only if payment is assured (i.e., if the payment is contingent or conditional on some
event such as the employer's annual profits, the employer must guarantee payment even if the contingency is not
met). The full $60,000 annual wages or salary must be received by the employee in order for the employee to have
“exempt” status. The wages or salary required for “exempt” status cannot be decreased or pro rated based on the
employee's part-time work schedule; an H-1B nonimmigrant working part-time, whose actual annual compensation

is less than $60,000, would not qualify as exempt on the basis of wages, even if the worker's earnings, if projected to
a full-time work schedule, would theoretically exceed $60,000 in a year. Where an employee works for less than a
full year, the employee must receive at least the appropriate pro rata share of the $60,000 in order to be “exempt”
(e.g., an employee who resigns after three months must be paid at least $15,000). In the event of an investigation
pursuant to subpart I of this part, the Administrator will determine whether the employee has received the required
$60,000 per year, using the employee's anniversary date to determine the one-year period; for an employee who had
worked for less than a full year (either at the beginning of employment, or after his/her last anniversary date), the
determination as to the $60,000 annual wages will be on a pro rata basis (i.e., whether the employee had been paid
at a rate of $60,000 per year (or $5,000 per month) including any unpaid, guaranteed bonuses or similar
compensation).
(d) How is the “master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended
employment” to be determined? (1) “Master's or higher degree (or its equivalent),” for purposes of this section
means a foreign academic degree from an institution which is accredited or recognized under the law of the country
where the degree was obtained, and which is equivalent to a master's or higher degree issued by a U.S. academic
institution. The equivalence to a U.S. academic degree cannot be established through experience or through
demonstration of expertise in the academic specialty (i.e., no “time equivalency” or “performance equivalency” will
be recognized as substituting for a degree issued by an academic institution). The DHS and the Department will
consult appropriate sources of expertise in making the determination of equivalency between foreign and U.S.
academic degrees. Upon the request of the DHS or the Department, the employer shall provide evidence to establish
that the H-1B nonimmigrant has received the degree, that the degree was earned in the asserted field of study,
including an academic transcript of courses, and that the institution from which the degree was obtained was
accredited or recognized.
(2) “Specialty related to the intended employment,” for purposes of this section, means that the academic
degree is in a specialty which is generally accepted in the industry or occupation as an appropriate or necessary
credential or skill for the person who undertakes the employment in question. A “specialty” which is not generally
accepted as appropriate or necessary to the employment would not be considered to be sufficiently “related' to afford
the H-1B nonimmigrant status as an “exempt H-1B nonimmigrant.”
(e) When and how is the determination of the H-1B nonimmigrant's “exempt” status to be made? An
employer that is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator (as described in §655.736) may designate on the LCA that the
LCA will be used only to support H-1B petition(s) and/or request(s) for extension of status for “exempt” H-1B
nonimmigrants.
(1) If the employer makes the designation of “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrant(s) on the LCA, then the DHS—as
part of the adjudication of the H-1B petition or request for extension of status—will determine the worker's
“exempt” status, since an H-1B petition must be supported by an LCA consistent with the petition (i.e., occupation,
area of intended employment, exempt status). The employer shall maintain, in the public access file maintained in
accordance with §755.760, a list of the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) whose petition(s) and/or request(s) are supported by
LCA(s) which the employer has attested will be used only for exempt H-1B nonimmigrants. In the event of an
investigation under subpart I of this part, the Administrator will give conclusive effect to an DHS determination of
“exempt” status based on the nonimmigrant's educational attainments (i.e., master's or higher degree (or its
equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment) unless the determination was based on false
information. If the DHS determination of “exempt” status was based on the assertion that the nonimmigrant would
receive wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000, the
employer shall provide evidence to show that such wages actually were received by the nonimmigrant (consistent
with paragraph (c) of this section and the regulatory standards for satisfaction or payment of the required wages as
described in §655.731(c)(3)).
(2) If the employer makes the designation of “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants on the LCA, but is found in an
enforcement action under subpart I of this part to have used the LCA to employ nonimmigrants who are, in fact, not
exempt, then the employer will be subject to a finding that it failed to comply with the nondisplacement and
recruitment obligations (as described in §§655.738 and 655.739, respectively) and may be assessed appropriate
penalties and remedies.

(3) If the employer does not make the designation of “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants on the LCA, then the
employer has waived the option of not being subject to the additional LCA attestation obligations on the basis of
employing only exempt H-1B nonimmigrants under the LCA. In the event of an investigation under subpart I of this
part, the Administrator will not consider the question of the nonimmigrant(s)'s “exempt” status in determining
whether an H-1B-dependent employer or willful violator employer has complied with such additional LCA
attestation obligations.
[65 FR 80227, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.738 What are the “non-displacement of U.S. workers” obligations that apply to H-1B-dependent
employers and willful violators, and how do they operate?
An employer that is subject to these additional attestation obligations (under the standards described in
§655.736) is prohibited from displacement of any U.S. worker(s)—whether directly (in its own workforce) or
secondarily (at a worksite of a second employer)—under the standards set out in this section.
(a) United States worker (U.S. worker) is defined in §655.715.
(b) Displacement, for purposes of this section, has two components: “lay off” of U.S. worker(s), and
“essentially equivalent jobs” held by U.S. worker(s) and H-1B nonimmigrant(s).
(1) Lay off of a U.S. worker means that the employer has caused the worker's loss of employment, other than
through—
(i) Discharge of a U.S. worker for inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, or other cause related
to the worker's performance or behavior on the job;
(ii) A U.S. worker's voluntary departure or voluntary retirement (to be assessed in light of the totality of the
circumstances, under established principles concerning “constructive discharge” of workers who are pressured to
leave employment);
(iii) Expiration of a grant or contract under which a U.S. worker is employed, other than a temporary
employment contract entered into in order to evade the employer's non-displacement obligation. The question is
whether the loss of the contract or grant has caused the worker's loss of employment. It would not be a layoff where
the job loss results from the expiration of a grant or contract without which there is no alternative funding or need
for the U.S. worker's position on that or any other grant or contract (e.g., the expiration of a research grant that
funded a project on which the worker was employed at an academic or research institution; the expiration of a
staffing firm's contract with a customer where the U.S. worker was hired expressly to work pursuant to that contract
and the employer has no practice of moving workers to other customers or projects upon the expiration of
contract(s)). On the other hand, it would be a layoff where the employer's normal practice is to move the U.S.
worker from one contract to another when a contract expires, and work on another contract for which the worker is
qualified is available (e.g., staffing firm's contract with one customer ends and another contract with a different
customer begins); or
(iv) A U.S. worker who loses employment is offered, as an alternative to such loss, a similar employment
opportunity with the same employer (or, in the case of secondary displacement at a worksite of a second employer,
as described in paragraph (d) of this section, a similar employment opportunity with either employer) at equivalent
or higher compensation and benefits than the position from which the U.S. worker was discharged, regardless of
whether or not the U.S. worker accepts the offer. The validity of the offer of a similar employment opportunity will
be assessed in light of the following factors:
(A) The offer is a bona fide offer, rather than an offer designed to induce the U.S. worker to refuse or an offer
made with the expectation that the worker will refuse;

(B) The offered job provides the U.S. worker an opportunity similar to that provided in the job from which
he/she is discharged, in terms such as a similar level of authority, discretion, and responsibility, a similar opportunity
for advancement within the organization, and similar tenure and work scheduling;
(C) The offered job provides the U.S. worker equivalent or higher compensation and benefits to those
provided in the job from which he/she is discharged. The comparison of compensation and benefits includes all
forms of remuneration for employment, whether or not called wages and irrespective of the time of payment (e.g.,
salary or hourly wage rate; profit sharing; retirement plan; expense account; use of company car). The comparison
also includes such matters as cost of living differentials and relocation expenses (e.g., a New York City
“opportunity” at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits offered to a worker discharged from a job in
Kansas City would provide a wage adjustment from the Kansas City pay scale and would include relocation costs).
(2) Essentially equivalent jobs. For purposes of the displacement prohibition, the job from which the U.S.
worker is laid off must be essentially equivalent to the job for which an H-1B nonimmigrant is sought. To determine
whether the jobs of the laid off U.S. worker(s) and the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) are essentially equivalent, the
comparison(s) shall be on a one-to-one basis where appropriate (i.e., one U.S. worker left employment and one H1B nonimmigrant joined the workforce) but shall be broader in focus where appropriate (e.g., an employer, through
reorganization, eliminates an entire department with several U.S. workers and then staffs this department's
function(s) with H-1B nonimmigrants). The following comparisons are to be made:
(i) Job responsibilities. The job of the H-1B nonimmigrant must involve essentially the same duties and
responsibilities as the job from which the U.S. worker was laid off. The comparison focuses on the core elements of
and competencies for the job, such as supervisory duties, or design and engineering functions, or budget and
financial accountability. Peripheral, non-essential duties that could be tailored to the particular abilities of the
individual workers would not be determinative in this comparison. The job responsibilities must be similar and both
workers capable of performing those duties.
(ii) Qualifications and experience of the workers. The qualifications of the laid off U.S. worker must be
substantially equivalent to the qualifications of the H-1B nonimmigrant. The comparison is to be confined to the
experience and qualifications (e.g., training, education, ability) of the workers which are directly relevant to the
actual performance requirements of the job, including the experience and qualifications that would materially affect
a worker's relative ability to perform the job better or more efficiently. While it would be appropriate to compare
whether the workers in question have “substantially equivalent” qualifications and experience, the workers need not
have identical qualifications and experience (e.g., a bachelor's degree from one accredited university would be
considered to be substantially equivalent to a bachelor's degree from another accredited university; 15 years
experience in an occupation would be substantially equivalent to 10 years experience in that occupation). It would
not be appropriate to compare the workers' relative ages, their sexes, or their ethnic or religious identities.
(iii) Area of employment. The job of the H-1B nonimmigrant must be located in the same area of employment
as the job from which the U.S. worker was laid off. The comparison of the locations of the jobs is confined to the
area within normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location where the work of the H-1B
nonimmigrant is or will be performed. For purposes of this comparison, if both such worksites or locations are
within a Metropolitan Statistical Area or a Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, they will be deemed to be within
the same area of employment.
(3) The worker's rights under a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract are not affected
by the employer's LCA obligations as to non-displacement of such worker.
(c) Direct displacement. An H-1B-dependent or willful-violator employer (as described in §655.736) is
prohibited from displacing a U.S. worker in its own workforce (i.e., a U.S. worker “employed by the employer”)
within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the filing date of an H-1B petition supported by
an LCA described in §655.736(g). The following standards and guidance apply under the direct displacement
prohibition:

(1) Which U.S. workers are protected against “direct displacement”? This prohibition covers the H-1B
employer's own workforce—U.S. workers “employed by the employer”—who are employed in jobs that are
essentially equivalent to the jobs for which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) are sought (as described in paragraph (b)(2)
of this section). The term “employed by the employer” is defined in §655.715.
(2) When does the “direct displacement” prohibition apply? The H-1B employer is prohibited from displacing
a U.S. worker during a specific period of time before and after the date on which the employer files any H-1B
petition supported by the LCA which is subject to the non-displacement obligation (as described in §655.736(g)).
This protected period is from 90 days before until 90 days after the petition filing date.
(3) What constitutes displacement of a U.S. worker? The H-1B employer is prohibited from laying off a U.S.
worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of the job for which an H-1B nonimmigrant is sought (as
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).
(d) Secondary displacement. An H-1B-dependent or willful-violator employer (as described in §655.736) is
prohibited from placing certain H-1B nonimmigrant(s) with another employer where there are indicia of an
employment relationship between the nonimmigrant and that other employer (thus possibly affecting the jobs of
U.S. workers employed by that other employer), unless and until the H-1B employer makes certain inquiries and/or
has certain information concerning that other employer's displacement of similarly employed U.S. workers in its
workforce. Employers are cautioned that even if the required inquiry of the secondary employer is made, the H-1Bdependent or willful violator employer shall be subject to a finding of a violation of the secondary displacement
prohibition if the secondary employer, in fact, displaces any U.S. worker(s) during the applicable time period (see
§655.810(d)). The following standards and guidance apply under the secondary displacement prohibition:
(1) Which U.S. workers are protected against “secondary displacement”? This provision applies to U.S.
workers employed by the other or “secondary” employer (not those employed by the H-1B employer) in jobs that
are essentially equivalent to the jobs for which certain H-1B nonimmigrants are placed with the other/secondary
employer (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). The term “employed by the employer” is defined in
§655.715.
(2) Which H-1B nonimmigrants activate the secondary displacement prohibition? Not every placement of an
H-1B nonimmigrant with another employer will activate the prohibition and—depending upon the particular facts—
an H-1B employer (such as a service provider) may be able to place H-1B nonimmigrant(s) at a client or customer's
worksite without being subject to the prohibition. The prohibition applies to the placement of an H-1B
nonimmigrant whose H-1B petition is supported by an LCA described in §655.736(g) and whose placement with the
other/secondary employer meets both of the following criteria:
(i) The nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part at one or more worksites owned, operated, or
controlled by the other/secondary employer; and
(ii) There are indicia of an employment relationship between the nonimmigrant and the other/secondary
employer. The relationship between the H-1B-nonimmigrant and the other/secondary need not constitute an
“employment” relationship (as defined in §655.715), and the applicability of the secondary displacement provision
does not establish such a relationship. Relevant indicia of an employment relationship include:
(A) The other/secondary employer has the right to control when, where, and how the nonimmigrant performs
the job (the presence of this indicia would suggest that the relationship between the nonimmigrant and the
other/secondary employer approaches the relationship which triggers the secondary displacement provision);
(B) The other/secondary employer furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment;
(C) The work is performed on the premises of the other/secondary employer (this indicia alone would not
trigger the secondary displacement provision);

(D) There is a continuing relationship between the nonimmigrant and the other/secondary employer;
(E) The other/secondary employer has the right to assign additional projects to the nonimmigrant;
(F) The other/secondary employer sets the hours of work and the duration of the job;
(G) The work performed by the nonimmigrant is part of the regular business (including governmental,
educational, and non-profit operations) of the other/secondary employer;
(H) The other/secondary employer is itself in business; and
(I) The other/secondary employer can discharge the nonimmigrant from providing services.
(3) What other/secondary employers are included in the prohibition on secondary displacement of U.S.
workers by the H-1B employer? The other/secondary employer who accepts the placement and/or services of the H1B employer's nonimmigrant employee(s) need not be an H-1B employer. The other/secondary employer would
often be (but is not limited to) the client or customer of an H-1B employer that is a staffing firm or a service
provider which offers the services of H-1B nonimmigrants under a contract (e.g., a medical staffing firm under
contract with a nursing home provides H-1B nonimmigrant physical therapists; an information technology staffing
firm under contract with a bank provides H-1B nonimmigrant computer engineers). Only the H-1B employer
placing the nonimmigrant with the secondary employer is subject to the non-displacement obligation on the LCA,
and only that employer is liable in an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part if the other/secondary
employer, in fact, displaces any of its U.S. worker(s) during the applicable time period. The other/secondary
employer will not be subject to sanctions in an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part (except in
circumstances where such other/secondary employer is, in fact, an H-1B employer and is found to have failed to
comply with its own obligations). (Note to paragraph (d)(3): Where the other/secondary employer's relationship to
the H-1B nonimmigrant constitutes “employment” for purposes of a statute other than the H-1B provision of the
INA, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), the other/secondary employer would be subject
to all obligations of an employer of the nonimmigrant under such other statute.)
(4) When does the “secondary displacement” prohibition apply? The H-1B employer's obligation of inquiry
concerns the actions of the other/secondary employer during the specific period beginning 90 days before and
ending 90 days after the date of the placement of the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) with such other/secondary employer.
(5) What are the H-1B employer's obligations concerning inquiry and/or information as to the
other/secondary employer's displacement of U.S. workers? The H-1B employer is prohibited from placing the H-1B
nonimmigrant with another employer, unless the H-1B employer has inquired of the other/secondary employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of
such placement, the other/secondary employer has displaced or intends to displace a similarly-employed U.S.
worker employed by such other/secondary employer. The following standards and guidance apply to the H-1B
employer's obligation:
(i) The H-1B employer is required to exercise due diligence and to make a reasonable effort to enquire about
potential secondary displacement, through methods which may include (but are not limited to)—
(A) Securing and retaining a written assurance from the other/secondary employer that it has not and does not
intend to displace a similarly-employed U.S. worker within the prescribed period;
(B) Preparing and retaining a memorandum to the file, prepared at the same time or promptly after receiving
the other/secondary employer's oral statement that it has not and does not intend to displace a similarly-employed
U.S. worker within the prescribed period (such memorandum shall include the substance of the conversation, the
date of the communication, and the names of the individuals who participated in the conversation, including the

person(s) who made the inquiry on behalf of the H-1B employer and made the statement on behalf of the
other/secondary employer); or
(C) including a secondary displacement clause in the contract between the H-1B employer and the
other/secondary employer, whereby the other/secondary employer would agree that it has not and will not displace
similarly-employed U.S. workers within the prescribed period.
(ii) The employer's exercise of due diligence may require further, more particularized inquiry of the
other/secondary employer in circumstances where there is information which indicates that U.S. worker(s) have
been or will be displaced (e.g., where the H-1B nonimmigrants will be performing functions that the other/secondary
employer performed with its own workforce in the past). The employer is not permitted to disregard information
which would provide knowledge about potential secondary displacement (e.g., newspaper reports of relevant layoffs by the other/secondary employer) if such information becomes available before the H-1B employer's placement
of H-1B nonimmigrants with such employer. Under such circumstances, the H-1B employer would be expected to
recontact the other/secondary employer and receive credible assurances that no lay-offs of similarly-employed U.S.
workers are planned or have occurred within the prescribed period.
(e) What documentation is required of H-1B employers concerning the non-displacement obligation? The H1B employer is responsible for demonstrating its compliance with the non-displacement obligation (whether direct
or indirect), if applicable.
(1) Concerning direct displacement (as described in paragraph (c) of this section), the employer is required to
retain all records the employer creates or receives concerning the circumstances under which each U.S. worker, in
the same locality and same occupation as any H-1B nonimmigrant(s) hired, left its employ in the period from 90
days before to 90 days after the filing date of the employer's petition for the H-1B nonimmigrant(s), and for any
such U.S. worker(s) for whom the employer has taken any action during the period from 90 days before to 90 days
after the filing date of the H-1B petition to cause the U.S. worker's termination (e.g., a notice of future termination
of the employee's job). For all such employees, the H-1B employer shall retain at least the following documents: the
employee's name, last-known mailing address, occupational title and job description; any documentation concerning
the employee's experience and qualifications, and principal assignments; all documents concerning the departure of
such employees, such as notification by the employer of termination of employment prepared by the employer or the
employee and any responses thereto, and evaluations of the employee's job performance. Finally, the employer is
required to maintain a record of the terms of any offers of similar employment to such U.S. workers and the
employee's response thereto.
(2) Concerning secondary displacement (as described in paragraph (d) of this section), the H-1B employer is
required to maintain documentation to show the manner in which it satisfied its obligation to make inquiries as to the
displacement of U.S. workers by the other/secondary employer with which the H-1B employer places any H-1B
nonimmigrants (as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section).
[65 FR 80228, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.739 What is the “recruitment of U.S. workers” obligation that applies to H-1B-dependent employers
and willful violators, and how does it operate?
An employer that is subject to this additional attestation obligation (under the standards described in
§655.736) is required—prior to filing the LCA or any petition or request for extension of status supported by the
LCA—to take good faith steps to recruit U. S. workers in the United States for the job(s) in the United States for
which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is/are sought. The recruitment shall use procedures that meet industry-wide
standards and offer compensation that is at least as great as the required wage to be paid to H-1B nonimmigrants
pursuant to §655.731(a) (i.e., the higher of the local prevailing wage or the employer's actual wage). The employer
may use legitimate selection criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the type of job involved, so
long as such criteria are not applied in a discriminatory manner. This section provides guidance for the employer's
compliance with the recruitment obligation.

(a) “United States worker” (“U.S. worker”) is defined in §655.715.
(b) “Industry,” for purposes of this section, means the set of employers which primarily compete for the same
types of workers as those who are the subjects of the H-1B petitions to be filed pursuant to the LCA. Thus, a
hospital, university, or computer software development firm is to use the recruitment standards utilized by the health
care, academic, or information technology industries, respectively, in hiring workers in the occupations in question.
Similarly, a staffing firm, which places its workers at job sites of other employers, is to use the recruitment standards
of the industry which primarily employs such workers (e.g., the health care industry, if the staffing firm is placing
physical therapists (whether in hospitals, nursing homes, or private homes); the information technology industry, if
the staffing firm is placing computer programmers, software engineers, or other such workers).
(c) “Recruitment,” for purposes of this section, means the process by which an employer seeks to contact or to
attract the attention of person(s) who may apply for employment, solicits applications from person(s) for
employment, receives applications, and reviews and considers applications so as to present the appropriate
candidates to the official(s) who make(s) the hiring decision(s) (i.e., pre-selection treatment of applications and
applicants).
(d) “Solicitation methods,” for purposes of this section, means the techniques by which an employer seeks to
contact or to attract the attention of potential applicants for employment, and to solicit applications from person(s)
for employment.
(1) Solicitation methods may be either external or internal to the employer's workforce (with internal
solicitation to include current and former employees).
(2) Solicitation methods may be either active (where an employer takes positive, proactive steps to identify
potential applicants and to get information about its job openings into the hands of such person(s)) or passive (where
potential applicants find their way to an employer's job announcements).
(i) Active solicitation methods include direct communication to incumbent workers in the employer's
operation and to workers previously employed in the employer's operation and elsewhere in the industry; providing
training to incumbent workers in the employer's organization; contact and outreach through collective bargaining
organizations, trade associations and professional associations; participation in job fairs (including at minorityserving institutions, community/junior colleges, and vocational/technical colleges); use of placement services of
colleges, universities, community/junior colleges, and business/trade schools; use of public and/or private
employment agencies, referral agencies, or recruitment agencies (“headhunters”).
(ii) Passive solicitation methods include advertising in general distribution publications, trade or professional
journals, or special interest publications (e.g., student-oriented; targeted to underrepresented groups, including
minorities, persons with disabilities, and residents of rural areas); America's Job Bank or other Internet sites
advertising job vacancies; notices at the employer's worksite(s) and/or on the employer's Internet “home page.”
(e) How are “industry-wide standards for recruitment” to be identified? An employer is not required to utilize
any particular number or type of recruitment methods, and may make a determination of the standards for the
industry through methods such as trade organization surveys, studies by consultative groups, or reports/statements
from trade organizations. An employer which makes such a determination should be prepared to demonstrate the
industry-wide standards in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part. An employer's
recruitment shall be at a level and through methods and media which are normal, common or prevailing in the
industry, including those strategies that have been shown to be successfully used by employers in the industry to
recruit U.S. workers. An employer may not utilize only the lowest common denominator of recruitment methods
used in the industry, or only methods which could reasonably be expected to be likely to yield few or no U.S.
worker applicants, even if such unsuccessful recruitment methods are commonly used by employers in the industry.
An employer's recruitment methods shall include, at a minimum, the following:

(1) Both internal and external recruitment (i.e., both within the employer's workforce (former as well as
current workers) and among U.S. workers elsewhere in the economy); and
(2) At least some active recruitment, whether internal (e.g., training the employer's U.S. worker(s) for the
position(s)) or external (e.g., use of recruitment agencies or college placement services).
(f) How are “legitimate selection criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the type of job
involved” to be identified? In conducting recruitment of U.S. workers (i.e., in soliciting applications and in preselection screening or considering of applicants), an employer shall apply selection criteria which satisfy all of the
following three standards (i.e., paragraph (b) (1) through (3)). Under these standards, an employer would not apply
spurious criteria that discriminate against U.S. worker applicants in favor of H-1B nonimmigrants. An employer that
uses criteria which fail to meet these standards would be considered to have failed to conduct its recruitment of U.S.
workers in good faith.
(1) Legitimate criteria, meaning criteria which are legally cognizable and not violative of any applicable laws
(e.g., employer may not use age, sex, race or national origin as selection criteria);.
(2) Relevant to the job, meaning criteria which have a nexus to the job's duties and responsibilities; and
(3) Normal and customary to the type of job involved, meaning criteria which would be necessary or
appropriate based on the practices and expectations of the industry, rather than on the preferences of the particular
employer.
(g) What actions would constitute a prohibited “discriminatory manner” of recruitment? The employer shall
not apply otherwise-legitimate screening criteria in a manner which would skew the recruitment process in favor of
H-1B nonimmigrants. In other words, the employer's application of its screening criteria shall provide full and fair
solicitation and consideration of U.S. applicants. The recruitment would be considered to be conducted in a
discriminatory manner if the employer applied its screening criteria in a disparate manner (whether between H-1B
and U.S. workers, or between jobs where H-1B nonimmigrants are involved and jobs where such workers are not
involved). The employer would also be considered to be recruiting in a discriminatory manner if it used screening
criteria that are prohibited by any applicable discrimination law (e.g., sex, race, age, national origin). The employer
that conducts recruitment in a discriminatory manner would be considered to have failed to conduct its recruitment
of U.S. workers in good faith.
(h) What constitute “good faith steps” in recruitment of U.S. workers? The employer shall perform its
recruitment, as described in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, so as to offer fair opportunities for
employment to U.S. workers, without skewing the recruitment process against U.S. workers or in favor of H-1B
nonimmigrants. No specific regimen is required for solicitation methods seeking applicants or for pre-selection
treatment screening applicants. The employer's recruitment process, including pre-selection treatment, must assure
that U.S. workers are given a fair chance for consideration for a job, rather than being ignored or rejected through a
process that serves the employer's preferences with respect to the make up of its workforce (e.g., the Department
would look with disfavor on a practice of interviewing H-1B applicants but not U.S. applicants, or a practice of
screening the applications of H-1B nonimmigrants differently from the applications of U.S. workers). The employer
shall not exercise a preference for its incumbent nonimmigrant workers who do not yet have H-1B status (e.g.,
workers on student visas). The employer shall recruit in the United States, seeking U.S. worker(s), for the job(s) in
the United States for which H-1B nonimmigrant(s) are or will be sought.
(i) What documentation is the employer required to make or maintain, concerning its recruitment of U.S.
workers?
(1) The employer shall maintain documentation of the recruiting methods used, including the places and dates
of the advertisements and postings or other recruitment methods used, the content of the advertisements and
postings, and the compensation terms (if such are not included in the content of the advertisements and postings).
The documentation may be in any form, including copies of advertisements or proofs from the publisher, the order

or confirmation from the publisher, an electronic or printed copy of the Internet posting, or a memorandum to the
file.
(2) The employer shall retain any documentation it has received or prepared concerning the treatment of
applicants, such as copies of applications and/or related documents, test papers, rating forms, records regarding
interviews, and records of job offers and applicants' responses. To comply with this requirement, the employer is not
required to create any documentation it would not otherwise create.
(3) The documentation maintained by the employer shall be made available to the Administrator in the event
of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part. The documentation shall be maintained for the period of
time specified in §655.760.
(4) The employer's public access file maintained in accordance with §655.760 shall contain information
summarizing the principal recruitment methods used and the time frame(s) in which such recruitment methods were
used. This may be accomplished either through a memorandum or through copies of pertinent documents.
(j) In addition to conducting good faith recruitment of U.S. workers (as described in paragraphs (a) through (h)
of this section), the employer is required to have offered the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or
better qualified for the job than the H-1B nonimmigrant (see 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(G)(i)(II)); this requirement is
enforced by the Department of Justice (see 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(5); 20 CFR 655.705(c)).
[65 FR 80231, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.740 What actions are taken on labor condition applications?
(a) Actions on labor condition applications submitted for filing. Once a labor condition application has been
received from an employer, a determination shall be made by the ETA Certifying Officer whether to certify the
labor condition application or return it to the employer not certified.
(1) Certification of labor condition application. Where all items on Form ETA 9035 or Form ETA 9035E
have been completed, the form is not obviously inaccurate, and in the case of Form ETA 9035, it contains the
signature of the employer or its authorized agent or representative, the Certifying Officer shall certify the labor
condition application unless it falls within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The
Certifying Officer shall make a determination to certify or not certify the labor condition application within 7
working days of the date the application is received and date-stamped by the Department. If the labor condition
application is certified, the Certifying Officer shall return a certified copy of the labor condition application to the
employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative. The employer shall file the certified labor condition
application with the appropriate DHS office in the manner prescribed by DHS. The DHS shall determine whether
each occupational classification named in the certified labor condition application is a specialty occupation or is a
fashion model of distinguished merit and ability.
(2) Determinations not to certify labor condition applications. ETA shall not certify a labor condition
application and shall return such application to the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative,
when either or both of the following two conditions exists:
(i) When the Form ETA 9035 or 9035E is not properly completed. Examples of a Form ETA 9035 or 9035E
which is not properly completed include instances where the employer has failed to check all the necessary boxes; or
where the employer has failed to state the occupational classification, number of nonimmigrants sought, wage rate,
period of intended employment, place of intended employment, or prevailing wage and its source; or, in the case of
Form ETA 9035, where the application does not contain the signature of the employer or the employer's authorized
representative.
(ii) When the Form ETA 9035 or ETA 9035E contains obvious inaccuracies. An obvious inaccuracy will be
found if the employer files an application in error—e.g., where the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, after

notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to subpart I of this part, has notified ETA in writing that the employer
has been disqualified from employing H-1B nonimmigrants under section 212(n)(2) of the INA (8 U.S.C.
1182(n)(2)) or from employing H-1B1 or E-3 nonimmigrants under section 212(t)(3) of the INA (8 U.S.C.
1182(t)(3)). Examples of other obvious inaccuracies include stating a wage rate below the FLSA minimum wage,
submitting an LCA earlier than six months before the beginning date of the period of intended employment,
identifying multiple occupations on a single LCA, identifying a wage which is below the prevailing wage listed on
the LCA, or identifying a wage range where the bottom of such wage range is lower than the prevailing wage listed
on the LCA.
(3) Correction and resubmission of labor condition application. If the labor condition application is not
certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, ETA shall return it to the employer, or the employer's
authorized agent or representative, explaining the reasons for such return without certification. The employer may
immediately submit a corrected application to ETA. A “resubmitted” or “corrected” labor condition application shall
be treated as a new application by ETA (i.e., on a “first come, first served” basis) except that if the labor condition
application is not certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because of notification by the
Administrator of the employer's disqualification, such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary and no
application shall be resubmitted by the employer.
(b) Challenges to labor condition applications. ETA shall not consider information contesting a labor
condition application received by ETA prior to the determination on the application. Such information shall not be
made part of ETA's administrative record on the application, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a
complaint pursuant to subpart I of this part, and, if such application is certified by ETA, the complaint will be
handled by ESA under subpart I of this part.
(c) Truthfulness and adequacy of information. DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or
adequacy of a certified labor condition application. The burden of proof is on the employer to establish the
truthfulness of the information contained on the labor condition application.
[59 FR 65659, 65676, Dec. 20, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 80232, Dec. 20, 2000; 66 FR 63302, Dec. 5, 2001; 69 FR 68228, Nov.
23, 2004; 70 FR 72563, Dec. 5, 2005; 73 FR 19949, Apr. 11, 2008]

§655.750 What is the validity period of the labor condition application?
(a) Validity of certified labor condition applications. A labor condition application (LCA) certified under
§655.740 is valid for the period of employment indicated by the authorized DOL official on Form ETA 9035E or
ETA 9035. The validity period of an LCA will not begin before the application is certified. If the approved LCA is
the initial LCA issued for the nonimmigrant, the period of authorized employment must not exceed 3 years for an
LCA issued on behalf of an H-1B or H-1B1 nonimmigrant and must not exceed 2 years for an LCA issued on behalf
of an E-3 nonimmigrant. If the approved LCA is for an extension of an H-1B1 it must not exceed two years. The
period of authorized employment in the aggregate is based on the first date of employment and ends:
(1) In the case of an H-1B or initial H-1B1 LCA, on the latest date indicated or three years after the
employment start date under the LCA, whichever comes first; or
(2) In the case of an E-3 or an H-1B1 extension LCA, on the latest date indicated or two years after the
employment start date under the LCA, whichever comes first.
(b) Withdrawal of certified labor condition applications. (1) An employer who has filed a labor condition
application which has been certified pursuant to §655.740 of this part may withdraw such labor condition
application at any time before the expiration of the validity period of the application, provided that:
(i) H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants are not employed at the place of employment pursuant to the LCA;
and

(ii) The Administrator has not commenced an investigation of the particular application. Any such request for
withdrawal shall be null and void; and the employer shall remain bound by the labor condition application until the
enforcement proceeding is completed, at which time the application may be withdrawn.
(2) Requests for withdrawals must be in writing and must be sent to ETA, Office of Foreign Labor
Certification. ETA will publish the mailing address, and any future mailing address changes, in the FEDERAL
REGISTER, and will also post the address on the DOL Web site at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/.
(3) An employer shall comply with the “required wage rate” and “prevailing working conditions” statements
of its labor condition application required under §§655.731 and 655.732 of this part, respectively, even if such
application is withdrawn, at any time H-1B nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to the application, unless the
application is superseded by a subsequent application which is certified by ETA.
(4) An employer's obligation to comply with the “no strike or lockout” and “notice” statements of its labor
condition application (required under §§655.733 and 655.734 of this part, respectively), shall remain in effect and
the employer shall remain subject to investigation and sanctions for misrepresentation on these statements even if
such application is withdrawn, regardless of whether H-1B nonimmigrants are actually employed, unless the
application is superseded by a subsequent application which is certified by ETA.
(5) Only for the purpose of assuring the labor standards protections afforded under the H-1B program, where
an employer files a petition with DHS under the H-1B classification pursuant to a certified LCA that had been
withdrawn by the employer, such petition filing binds the employer to all obligations under the withdrawn LCA
immediately upon receipt of such petition by DHS.
(c) Invalidation or suspension of a labor condition application. (1) Invalidation of a labor condition
application shall result from enforcement action(s) by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, under subpart I
of this part—e.g., a final determination finding the employer's failure to meet the application's condition regarding
strike or lockout; or the employer's willful failure to meet the wage and working conditions provisions of the
application; or the employer's substantial failure to meet the notice of specification requirements of the application;
see §§655.734 and 655.760 of this part; or the misrepresentation of a material fact in an application. Upon notice by
the Administrator of the employer's disqualification, ETA shall invalidate the application and notify the employer,
or the employer's authorized agent or representative. ETA shall notify the employer in writing of the reason(s) that
the application is invalidated. When a labor condition application is invalidated, such action shall be the final
decision of the Secretary.
(2) Suspension of a labor condition application may result from a discovery by ETA that it made an error in
certifying the application because such application is incomplete, contains one or more obvious inaccuracies, or has
not been signed. In such event, ETA shall immediately notify DHS and the employer. When an application is
suspended, the employer may immediately submit to the certifying officer a corrected or completed application. If
ETA does not receive a corrected application within 30 days of the suspension, or if the employer was disqualified
by the Administrator, the application shall be immediately invalidated as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) An employer shall comply with the “required wages rate” and “prevailing working conditions” statements
of its labor condition application required under §§655.731 and 655.732 of this part, respectively, even if such
application is suspended or invalidated, at any time H-1B nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to the application,
unless the application is superseded by a subsequent application which is certified by ETA.
(4) An employer's obligation to comply with the “no strike or lockout” and “notice” statements of its labor
condition application (required under §§655.733 and 655.734 of this part, respectively), shall remain in effect and
the employer shall remain subject to investigation and sanctions for misrepresentation on these statements even if
such application is suspended or invalidated, regardless of whether H-1B nonimmigrants are actually employed,
unless the application is superseded by a subsequent application which is certified by ETA.

(d) Employers subject to disqualification. No labor condition application shall be certified for an employer
which has been found to be disqualified from participation, in the H-1B program as determined in a final agency
action following an investigation by the Wage and Hour Division pursuant to subpart I of this part.
[59 FR 65659, 65676, Dec. 20, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 80232, Dec. 20, 2000; 66 FR 63302, Dec. 5, 2001; 70 FR 72563, Dec.

§655.760 What records are to be made available to the public, and what records are to be retained?
Paragraphs (a)(1) thru (a)(6) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section also apply to the H-1B1 and E-3 visa
categories.
(a) Public examination. The employer shall make a filed labor condition application and necessary supporting
documentation available for public examination at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the
place of employment within one working day after the date on which the labor condition application is filed with
DOL. The following documentation shall be necessary:
(1) A copy of the certified labor condition application (Form ETA 9035E or Form ETA 9035) and cover pages
(Form ETA 9035CP). If the Form ETA 9035E is submitted electronically, a printout of the certified application shall
be signed by the employer and maintained in its files and included in the public examination file.
(2) Documentation which provides the wage rate to be paid the H-1B nonimmigrant;
(3) A full, clear explanation of the system that the employer used to set the “actual wage” the employer has
paid or will pay workers in the occupation for which the H-1B nonimmigrant is sought, including any periodic
increases which the system may provide—e.g., memorandum summarizing the system or a copy of the employer's
pay system or scale (payroll records are not required, although they shall be made available to the Department in an
enforcement action).
(4) A copy of the documentation the employer used to establish the “prevailing wage” for the occupation for
which the H-1B nonimmigrant is sought (a general description of the source and methodology is all that is required
to be made available for public examination; the underlying individual wage data relied upon to determine the
prevailing wage is not a public record, although it shall be made available to the Department in an enforcement
action); and
(5) A copy of the document(s) with which the employer has satisfied the union/employee notification
requirements of §655.734 of this part.
(6) A summary of the benefits offered to U.S. workers in the same occupational classifications as H-1B
nonimmigrants, a statement as to how any differentiation in benefits is made where not all employees are offered or
receive the same benefits (such summary need not include proprietary information such as the costs of the benefits
to the employer, or the details of stock options or incentive distributions), and/or, where applicable, a statement that
some/all H-1B nonimmigrants are receiving “home country” benefits (see §655.731(c)(3));
(7) Where the employer undergoes a change in corporate structure, a sworn statement by a responsible official
of the new employing entity that it accepts all obligations, liabilities and undertakings under the LCAs filed by the
predecessor employing entity, together with a list of each affected LCA and its date of certification, and a
description of the actual wage system and FEIN of the new employing entity (see §655.730(e)(1)).
(8) Where the employer utilizes the definition of “single employer”in the IRC, a list of any entities included as
part of the single employer in making the determination as to its H-1B-dependency status (see §655.736(d)(7));

(9) Where the employer is H-1B-dependent and/or a willful violator, and indicates on the LCA(s) that only
“exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed, a list of such “exempt” H-1B nonimmigrants (see
§655.737(e)(1));
(10) Where the employer is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator, a summary of the recruitment methods used
and the time frames of recruitment of U.S. workers (or copies of pertinent documents showing this information) (see
§655.739(i)(4).
(b) National lists of applications and attestations. ETA shall compile and maintain on a current basis a list of
the labor condition applications filed under INA section 212(n) regarding H-1B nonimmigrants and a list of labor
attestations filed under INA section 212(t) regarding H-1B1 nonimmigrants. Each list shall be by employer, showing
the occupational classification, wage rate(s), number of nonimmigrants sought, period(s) of intended employment,
and date(s) of need for each employer's application. The list shall be available for public examination at the Office
of Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington,
DC 20210.
(c) Retention of records. Either at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of
employment, the employer shall retain copies of the records required by this subpart for a period of one year beyond
the last date on which any H-1B nonimmigrant is employed under the labor condition application or, if no
nonimmigrants were employed under the labor condition application, one year from the date the labor condition
application expired or was withdrawn. Required payroll records for the H-1B employees and other employees in the
occupational classification shall be retained at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place
of employment for a period of three years from the date(s) of the creation of the record(s), except that if an
enforcement action is commenced, all payroll records shall be retained until the enforcement proceeding is
completed through the procedures set forth in subpart I of this part.

Subpart I—Enforcement of H-1B Labor Condition Applications and H-1B1 and
E-3 Labor Attestations
SOURCE: 59 FR 65672, 65676, Dec. 20, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

§655.800 Who will enforce the LCAs and how will they be enforced?
(a) Authority of Administrator. Except as provided in §655.807, the Administrator shall perform all the
Secretary's investigative and enforcement functions under sections 212(n) and (t) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(n) and
(t)) and this subpart I and subpart H of this part.
(b) Conduct of investigations. The Administrator, either pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, shall conduct
such investigations as may be appropriate and, in connection therewith, enter and inspect such places and such
records (and make transcriptions or copies thereof), question such persons and gather such information as deemed
necessary by the Administrator to determine compliance regarding the matters which are the subject of the
investigation.
(c) Employer cooperation/availability of records. An employer shall at all times cooperate in administrative
and enforcement proceedings. An employer being investigated shall make available to the Administrator such
records, information, persons, and places as the Administrator deems appropriate to copy, transcribe, question, or
inspect. No employer subject to the provisions of sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA and/or this subpart I or subpart H
of this part shall interfere with any official of the Department of Labor performing an investigation, inspection or
law enforcement function pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(n) or (t) or this subpart I or subpart H of this part. Any such

interference shall be a violation of the labor condition application and this subpart I and subpart H of this part, and
the Administrator may take such further actions as the Administrator considers appropriate. (Federal criminal
statutes prohibit certain interference with a Federal officer in the performance of official duties. 18 U.S.C. 111 and
18 U.S.C. 1114.)
(d) Confidentiality. The Administrator shall, to the extent possible under existing law, protect the
confidentiality of any person who provides information to the Department in confidence in the course of an
investigation or otherwise under this subpart I or subpart H of this part.
[65 FR 80233, Dec. 20, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 68228, Nov. 23, 2004]

§655.801 What protection do employees have from retaliation?
(a) No employer subject to this subpart I or subpart H of this part shall intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce,
blacklist, discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee (which term includes a former
employee or an applicant for employment) because the employee has—
(1) Disclosed information to the employer, or to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes
evidences a violation of sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA or any regulation relating to sections 212(n) or (t),
including this subpart I and subpart H of this part and any pertinent regulations of DHS or the Department of Justice;
or
(2) Cooperated or sought to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding concerning the employer's
compliance with the requirements of sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA or any regulation relating to sections 212(n) or
(t).
(b) It shall be a violation of this section for any employer to engage in the conduct described in paragraph (a)
of this section. Such conduct shall be subject to the penalties prescribed by sections 212(n)(2)(C)(ii) or (t)(3)(C)(ii)
of the INA and §655.810(b)(2), i.e., a fine of up to $5,000, disqualification from filing petitions under section 204 or
section 214(c) of the INA for at least two years, and such further administrative remedies as the Administrator
considers appropriate.
(c) Pursuant to sections 212(n)(2)(C)(v) and (t)(3)(C)(v) of the INA, an H-1B nonimmigrant who has filed a
complaint alleging that an employer has discriminated against the employee in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this
section may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the United States, provided the employee is
otherwise eligible to remain and work in the United States. Such employment may not exceed the maximum period
of stay authorized for a nonimmigrant classified under sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA, as applicable. Further
information concerning this provision should be sought from the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services of the Department of Homeland Security.
[65 FR 80233, Dec. 20, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 68229, Nov. 23, 2004; 71 FR 35521, June 21, 2006]

§655.805 What violations may the Administrator investigate?
(a) The Administrator, through investigation, shall determine whether an H-1B employer has—
(1) Filed a labor condition application with ETA which misrepresents a material fact (Note to paragraph
(a)(1): Federal criminal statutes provide penalties of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years for
knowing and willful submission of false statements to the Federal Government. 18 U.S.C. 1001; see also 18 U.S.C.
1546);
(2) Failed to pay wages (including benefits provided as compensation for services), as required under
§655.731 (including payment of wages for certain nonproductive time);

(3) Failed to provide working conditions as required under §655.732;
(4) Filed a labor condition application for H-1B nonimmigrants during a strike or lockout in the course of a
labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place of employment, as prohibited by §655.733;
(5) Failed to provide notice of the filing of the labor condition application, as required in §655.734;
(6) Failed to specify accurately on the labor condition application the number of workers sought, the
occupational classification in which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) will be employed, or the wage rate and conditions
under which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) will be employed;
(7) Displaced a U.S. worker (including displacement of a U.S. worker employed by a secondary employer at
the worksite where an H-1B worker is placed), as prohibited by §655.738 (if applicable);
(8) Failed to make the required displacement inquiry of another employer at a worksite where H-1B
nonimmigrant(s) were placed, as set forth in §655.738 (if applicable);
(9) Failed to recruit in good faith, as required by §655.739 (if applicable);
(10) Displaced a U.S. worker in the course of committing a willful violation of any of the conditions in
paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section, or willful misrepresentation of a material fact on a labor condition
application;
(11) Required or accepted from an H-1B nonimmigrant payment or remittance of the additional $500/$1,000
fee incurred in filing an H-1B petition with the DHS, as prohibited by §655.731(c)(10)(ii);
(12) Required or attempted to require an H-1B nonimmigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment prior to
an agreed upon date, as prohibited by §655.731(c)(10)(i);
(13) Discriminated against an employee for protected conduct, as prohibited by §655.801;
(14) Failed to make available for public examination the application and necessary document(s) at the
employer's principal place of business or worksite, as required by §655.760(a);
(15) Failed to maintain documentation, as required by this part; and
(16) Failed otherwise to comply in any other manner with the provisions of this subpart I or subpart H of this
part.
(b) The determination letter setting forth the investigation findings (see §655.815) shall specify if the
violations were found to be substantial or willful. Penalties may be assessed and disqualification ordered for
violation of the provisions in paragraphs (a)(5), (6), or (9) of this section only if the violation was found to be
substantial or willful. The penalties may be assessed and disqualification ordered for violation of the provisions in
paragraphs (a)(2) or (3) of this section only if the violation was found to be willful, but the Secretary may order
payment of back wages (including benefits) due for such violation whether or not the violation was willful.
(c) For purposes of this part, “willful failure” means a knowing failure or a reckless disregard with respect to
whether the conduct was contrary to sections 212(n)(1)(A)(i) or (ii), or 212(t)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of the INA, or
§§655.731 or 655.732. See McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128 (1988); see also Trans World Airlines v.
Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 (1985).

(d) The provisions of this part become applicable upon the date that the employer's LCA is certified pursuant
to §§655.740 and 655.750, or upon the date employment commences pursuant to section 214(m) of the INA,
whichever is earlier. The employer's submission and signature on the LCA (whether Form ETA 9035 or Form ETA
9035E) each constitutes the employer's representation that the statements on the LCA are accurate and its
acknowledgment and acceptance of the obligations of the program. The employer's acceptance of these obligations
is re-affirmed by the employer's submission of the petition (Form I-129) to the DHS, supported by the LCA. See 8
CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(B)(2), which specifies that the employer will comply with the terms of the LCA for the
duration of the H-1B nonimmigrant's authorized period of stay. If the period of employment specified in the LCA
expires or the employer withdraws the application in accordance with §655.750(b), the provisions of this part will no
longer apply with respect to such application, except as provided in §655.750(b)(3) and (4).

§655.806 Who may file a complaint and how is it processed?
(a) Any aggrieved party, as defined in §655.715, may file a complaint alleging a violation described in
§655.805(a). The procedures for filing a complaint by an aggrieved party and its processing by the Administrator are
set forth in this section. The procedures for filing and processing information alleging violations from persons or
organizations that are not aggrieved parties are set forth in §655.807. With regard to complaints filed by any
aggrieved person or organization—
(1) No particular form of complaint is required, except that the complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be
reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives the complaint.
(2) The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine whether there is reasonable
cause to believe that a violation as described in §655.805 has been committed, and therefore that an investigation is
warranted. This determination shall be made within 10 days of the date that the complaint is received by a Wage and
Hour Division official. If the Administrator determines that the complaint fails to present reasonable cause for an
investigation, the Administrator shall so notify the complainant, who may submit a new complaint, with such
additional information as may be necessary. No hearing or appeal pursuant to this subpart shall be available where
the Administrator determines that an investigation on a complaint is not warranted.
(3) If the Administrator determines that an investigation on a complaint is warranted, the complaint shall be
accepted for filing; an investigation shall be conducted and a determination issued within 30 calendar days of the
date of filing. The time for the investigation may be increased with the consent of the employer and the complainant,
or if, for reasons outside of the control of the Administrator, the Administrator needs additional time to obtain
information needed from the employer or other sources to determine whether a violation has occurred. No hearing or
appeal pursuant to this subpart shall be available regarding the Administrator's determination that an investigation
on a complaint is warranted.
(4) In the event that the Administrator seeks a prevailing wage determination from ETA pursuant to
§655.731(d), or advice as to prevailing working conditions from ETA pursuant to §655.732(c)(2), the 30-day
investigation period shall be suspended from the date of the Administrator's request to the date of the
Administrator's receipt of the wage determination (or, in the event that the employer challenges the wage
determination through the Employment Service complaint system, to the date of the completion of such complaint
process).
(5) A complaint must be filed not later than 12 months after the latest date on which the alleged violation(s)
were committed, which would be the date on which the employer allegedly failed to perform an action or fulfill a
condition specified in the LCA, or the date on which the employer, through its action or inaction, allegedly
demonstrated a misrepresentation of a material fact in the LCA. This jurisdictional bar does not affect the scope of
the remedies which may be assessed by the Administrator. Where, for example, a complaint is timely filed, back
wages may be assessed for a period prior to one year before the filing of a complaint.

(6) A complaint may be submitted to any local Wage and Hour Division office. The addresses of such offices
are found in local telephone directories, and on the Department's informational site on the Internet at
http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/contacts/whd/america2.htm. The office or person receiving such a complaint shall
refer it to the office of the Wage and Hour Division administering the area in which the reported violation is alleged
to have occurred.
(b) When an investigation has been conducted, the Administrator shall, pursuant to §655.815, issue a written
determination as described in §655.805(a).
[65 FR 80234, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.807 How may someone who is not an “aggrieved party” allege violations, and how will those allegations
be processed?
(a) Persons who are not aggrieved parties may submit information concerning possible violations of the
provisions described in §655.805(a)(1) through (4) and (a)(7) through (9). No particular form is required to submit
the information, except that the information shall be submitted in writing or, if oral, shall be reduced to writing by
the Wage and Hour Division official who receives the information. An optional form shall be available to be used in
setting forth the information. The information provided shall include:
(1) The identity of the person submitting the information and the person's relationship, if any, to the employer
or other information concerning the person's basis for having knowledge of the employer's employment practices or
its compliance with the requirements of this subpart I and subpart H of this part; and
(2) A description of the possible violation, including a description of the facts known to the person submitting
the information, in sufficient detail for the Secretary to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe that the
employer has committed a willful violation of the provisions described in §655.805(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (8), or
(9).
(b) The Administrator may interview the person submitting the information as appropriate to obtain further
information to determine whether the requirements of this section are met. In addition, the person submitting
information under this section shall be informed that his or her identity will not be disclosed to the employer without
his or her permission.
(c) Information concerning possible violations must be submitted not later than 12 months after the latest date
on which the alleged violation(s) were committed. The 12-month period shall be applied in the manner described in
§655.806(a)(5).
(d) Upon receipt of the information, the Administrator shall promptly review the information submitted and
determine:
(1) Does the source likely possess knowledge of the employer's practices or employment conditions or the
employer's compliance with the requirements of subpart H of this part?
(2) Has the source provided specific credible information alleging a violation of the requirements of the
conditions described in §655.805(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (8), or (9)?
(3) Does the information in support of the allegations appear to provide reasonable cause to believe that the
employer has committed a violation of the provisions described in §655.805(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (8), or (9), and
that
(i) The alleged violation is willful?

(ii) The employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations? or
(iii) The employer has committed substantial violations, affecting multiple employees?
(e) “Information” within the meaning of this section does not include information from an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor unless it was obtained in the course of a lawful investigation, and does not include
information submitted by the employer to the DHS or the Secretary in securing the employment of an H-1B
nonimmigrant.
(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, where the Administrator has received information
from a source other than an aggrieved party which satisfies all of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of
this section, or where the Administrator or another agency of the Department obtains such information in a lawful
investigation under this or any other section of the INA or any other Act, the Administrator (by mail or facsimile
transmission) shall promptly notify the employer that the information has been received, describe the nature of the
allegation in sufficient detail to permit the employer to respond, and request that the employer respond to the
allegation within 10 days of its receipt of the notification. The Administrator shall not identify the source or
information which would reveal the identity of the source without his or her permission.
(2) The Administrator may dispense with notification to the employer of the alleged violations if the
Administrator determines that such notification might interfere with an effort to secure the employer's compliance.
This determination shall not be subject to review in any administrative proceeding and shall not be subject to
judicial review.
(g) After receipt of any response to the allegations provided by the employer, the Administrator will promptly
review all of the information received and determine whether the allegations should be referred to the Secretary for a
determination whether an investigation should be commenced by the Administrator.
(h) If the Administrator refers the allegations to the Secretary, the Secretary shall make a determination as to
whether to authorize an investigation under this section.
(1) No investigation shall be commenced unless the Secretary (or the Deputy Secretary or other Acting
Secretary in the absence or disability) personally authorizes the investigation and certifies—
(i) That the information provided under paragraph (a) of this section or obtained pursuant to a lawful
investigation by the Department of Labor provides reasonable cause to believe that the employer has committed a
violation of the provisions described in §655.805(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (8), or (9);
(ii) That there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged violations are willful, that the employer has engaged
in a pattern or practice of such violations, or that the employer has committed substantial violations, affecting
multiple employees; and
(iii) That the other requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section have been met.
(2) No hearing shall be available from a decision by the Administrator declining to refer allegations addressed
by this section to the Secretary, and none shall be available from a decision by the Secretary certifying or declining
to certify that an investigation is warranted.
(i) If the Secretary issues a certification, an investigation shall be conducted and a determination issued within
30 days after the certification is received by the local Wage and Hour office undertaking the investigation. The time
for the investigation may be increased upon the agreement of the employer and the Administrator or, if for reasons
outside of the control of the Administrator, additional time is necessary to obtain information needed from the
employer or other sources to determine whether a violation has occurred.

(j) In the event that the Administrator seeks a prevailing wage determination from ETA pursuant to
§655.731(d), or advice as to prevailing working conditions from ETA pursuant to §655.732(c)(2), the 30-day
investigation period shall be suspended from the date of the Administrator's request to the date of the
Administrator's receipt of the wage determination (or, in the event that the employer challenges the wage
determination through the Employment Service complaint system, to the date of the completion of such complaint
process).
(k) Following the investigation, the Administrator shall issue a determination in accordance with to §655.815.
(l) This section shall expire on September 30, 2003 unless section 212(n)(2)(G) of the INA is extended by
future legislative action. Absent such extension, no investigation shall be certified by the Secretary under this
section after that date; however, any investigation certified on or before September 30, 2003 may be completed.
[65 FR 80234, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.808 Under what circumstances may random investigations be conducted?
(a) The Administrator may conduct random investigations of an employer during a five-year period beginning
with the date of any of the following findings, provided such date is on or after October 21, 1998:
(1) A finding by the Secretary that the employer willfully violated
any of the provisions described in §655.805(a)(1) through (9);
(2) A finding by the Secretary that the employer willfully misrepresented material fact(s) in a labor condition
application filed pursuant to §655.730; or
(3) A finding by the Attorney General that the employer willfully failed to meet the condition of section
212(n)(1)(G)(i)(II) of the INA (pertaining to an offer of employment to an equally or better qualified U.S. worker).
(b) A finding within the meaning of this section is a final, unappealed decision of the agency. See
§§655.520(a), 655.845(c), and 655.855(b).
(c) An investigation pursuant to this section may be made at any time the Administrator, in the exercise of
discretion, considers appropriate, without regard to whether the Administrator has reason to believe a violation of
the provisions of this subpart I and subpart H of this part has been committed. Following an investigation, the
Administrator shall issue a determination in accordance with §655.815.
[65 FR 80236, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.810 What remedies may be ordered if violations are found?
(a) Upon determining that an employer has failed to pay wages or provide fringe benefits as required by
§655.731 and §655.732, the Administrator shall assess and oversee the payment of back wages or fringe benefits to
any H-1B nonimmigrant who has not been paid or provided fringe benefits as required. The back wages or fringe
benefits shall be equal to the difference between the amount that should have been paid and the amount that actually
was paid to (or with respect to) such nonimmigrant(s).
(b) Civil money penalties. The Administrator may assess civil money penalties for violations as follows:
(1) An amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation for:

(i) A violation pertaining to strike/lockout (§655.733) or displacement of U.S. workers (§655.738);
(ii) A substantial violation pertaining to notification (§655.734), labor condition application specificity
(§655.730), or recruitment of U.S. workers (§655.739);
(iii) A misrepresentation of material fact on the labor condition application;
(iv) An early-termination penalty paid by the employee (§655.731(c)(10)(i));
(v) Payment by the employee of the additional $500/$1,000 filing fee (§655.731(c)(10)(ii)); or
(vi) Violation of the requirements of the regulations in this subpart I and subpart H of this part or the
provisions regarding public access (§655.760) where the violation impedes the ability of the Administrator to
determine whether a violation of sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA has occurred or the ability of members of the
public to have information needed to file a complaint or information regarding alleged violations of sections 212(n)
or (t) of the INA;
(2) An amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation for:
(i) A willful failure pertaining to wages/working conditions (§§655.731, 655.732), strike/lockout, notification,
labor condition application specificity, displacement (including placement of an H-1B nonimmigrant at a worksite
where the other/secondary employer displaces a U.S. worker), or recruitment;
(ii) A willful misrepresentation of a material fact on the labor condition application; or
(iii) Discrimination against an employee (§655.801(a)); or
(3) An amount not to exceed $35,000 per violation where an employer (whether or not the employer is an H1B-dependent employer or willful violator) displaced a U.S. worker employed by the employer in the period
beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the filing of an H-1B petition in conjunction with any of the
following violations:
(i) A willful violation of any of the provisions described in §655.805(a)(2) through (9) pertaining to
wages/working condition, strike/lockout, notification, labor condition application specificity, displacement, or
recruitment; or
(ii) A willful misrepresentation of a material fact on the labor condition application (§655.805(a)(1)).
(c) In determining the amount of the civil money penalty to be assessed, the Administrator shall consider the
type of violation committed and other relevant factors. The factors which may be considered include, but are not
limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation, or violations, by the employer under the INA and this subpart I or subpart H
of this part;
(2) The number of workers affected by the violation or violations;
(3) The gravity of the violation or violations;
(4) Efforts made by the employer in good faith to comply with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1182(n) or (t) and
this subparts H and I of this part;

(5) The employer's explanation of the violation or violations;
(6) The employer's commitment to future compliance; and
(7) The extent to which the employer achieved a financial gain due to the violation, or the potential financial
loss, potential injury or adverse effect with respect to other parties.

that the employer shall be disqualified from approval of any petitions filed by, or on behalf of, the employer
pursuant to section 204 or section 214(c) of the INA for the following periods:
(1) At least one year for violation(s) of any of the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of
this section;
(2) At least two years for violation(s) of any of the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
(3) At least three years, for violation(s) specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(e) Other administrative remedies. (1) If the Administrator finds a violation of the provisions specified in
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) or (v) of this section, the Administrator may issue an order requiring the employer to return to
the employee (or pay to the U.S. Treasury if the employee cannot be located) any money paid by the employee in
violation of those provisions.
(2) If the Administrator finds a violation of the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (iii), (b)(2),
or (b)(3) of this section, the Administrator may impose such other administrative remedies as the Administrator
determines to be appropriate, including but not limited to reinstatement of workers who were discriminated against
in violation of §655.805(a), reinstatement of displaced U.S. workers, back wages to workers who have been
displaced or whose employment has been terminated in violation of these provisions, or other appropriate legal or
equitable remedies.
(f) The civil money penalties, back wages, and/or any other remedy(ies) determined by the Administrator to be
appropriate are immediately due for payment or performance upon the assessment by the Administrator, or upon the
decision by an administrative law judge where a hearing is timely requested, or upon the decision by the Secretary
where review is granted. The employer shall remit the amount of the civil money penalty by certified check or
money order made payable to the order of “Wage and Hour Division, Labor.” The remittance shall be delivered or
mailed to the Wage and Hour Division office in the manner directed in the Administrator's notice of determination.
The payment or performance of any other remedy prescribed by the Administrator shall follow procedures
established by the Administrator. Distribution of back wages shall be administered in accordance with existing
procedures established by the Administrator.
(g) The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires
that inflationary adjustments to civil money penalties in accordance with a specified cost-of-living formula be made,
by regulation, at least every four years. The adjustments are to be based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for
all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average for All Items. The adjusted amounts will be published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER. The amount of the penalty in a particular case will be based on the amount of the penalty in
effect at the time the violation occurs.

filed, the Administrator's determination shall be inoperative unless and until the case is dismissed or the
Administrative Law Judge issues an order affirming the decision.
(b) Interested parties may request a hearing in the following circumstances:
(1) The complainant or any other interested party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines,

§655.825 What rules of practice apply to the hearing?
(a) Except as specifically provided in this subpart, and to the extent they do not conflict with the provisions of

Law Judges” established by the Secretary at 29 CFR part 18 shall apply to administrative proceedings under this
subpart.
(b) As provided in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556, any oral or documentary evidence may be
received in proceedings under this part. The Federal Rules of Evidence and subpart B of the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges (29 CFR part 18, subpart B)
shall not apply, but principles designed to ensure production of relevant and probative evidence shall guide the
admission of evidence. The administrative law judge may exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or
unduly repetitive.
§655.830 What rules apply to service of pleadings?
(a) Under this subpart, a party may serve any pleading or document by regular mail. Service on a party is
complete upon mailing to the last known address. No additional time for filing or response is authorized where
service is by mail. In the interest of expeditious proceedings, the administrative law judge may direct the parties to
serve pleadings or documents by a method other than regular mail.
(b) Two (2) copies of all pleadings and other documents in any administrative law judge proceeding shall be
served on the attorneys for the Administrator. One copy shall be served on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair
Labor Standards, Office of the Solicitor, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-2716,

Washington, DC 20210, and one copy shall be served on the attorney representing the Administrator in the
proceeding.
(c) Time will be computed beginning with the day following the action and includes the last day of the period
unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or federally-observed holiday, in which case the time period includes the next
business day.
§655.835 How will the administrative law judge conduct the proceeding?
(a) Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing filed pursuant to and in accordance with §655.820 of this
part, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall promptly appoint an administrative law judge to hear the case.
(b) Within 7 calendar days following the assignment of the case, the administrative law judge shall notify all
interested parties of the date, time and place of the hearing. All parties shall be given at least fourteen calendar days
notice of such hearing.
(c) The date of the hearing shall be not more than 60 calendar days from the date of the Administrator's
determination. Because of the time constraints imposed by the INA, no request for postponement shall be granted
except for compelling reasons. Even where such reasons are shown, no request for postponement of the hearing
beyond the 60-day deadline shall be granted except by consent of all the parties to the proceeding.
(d) The administrative law judge may prescribe a schedule by which the parties are permitted to file a
prehearing brief or other written statement of fact or law. Any such brief or statement shall be served upon each
other party in accordance with §655.830 of this part. Posthearing briefs will not be permitted except at the request of
the administrative law judge. When permitted, any such brief shall be limited to the issue or issues specified by the
administrative law judge, shall be due within the time prescribed by the administrative law judge, and shall be
served on each other party in accordance with §655.830 of this part.
§655.840 What are the requirements for a decision and order of the administrative law judge?
(a) Within 60 calendar days after the date of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue a decision. If
any party desires review of the decision, including judicial review, a petition for Secretary's review thereof shall be
filed as provided in §655.845 of this subpart. If a petition for review is filed, the decision of the administrative law
judge shall be inoperative unless and until the Secretary issues an order affirming the decision, or, unless and until
30 calendar days have passed after the Secretary's receipt of the petition for review and the Secretary has not issued
notice to the parties that the Secretary will review the administrative law judge's decision.
(b) The decision of the administrative law judge shall include a statement of findings and conclusions, with
reasons and basis therefor, upon each material issue presented on the record. The decision shall also include an
appropriate order which may affirm, deny, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the determination of the
Administrator; the reason or reasons for such order shall be stated in the decision.
(c) In the event that the Administrator's determination of wage violation(s) and computation of back wages are
based upon a wage determination obtained by the Administrator from ETA during the investigation (pursuant to
§655.731(d)) and the administrative law judge determines that the Administrator's request was not warranted (under
the standards in §655.731(d)), the administrative law judge shall remand the matter to the Administrator for further
proceedings on the existence of wage violations and/or the amount(s) of back wages owed. If there is no such
determination and remand by the administrative law judge, the administrative law judge shall accept as final and
accurate the wage determination obtained from ETA or, in the event either the employer or another interested party
filed a timely complaint through the Employment Service complaint system, the final wage determination resulting
from that process. See §655.731; see also 20 CFR 658.420 through 658.426. Under no circumstances shall the
administrative law judge determine the validity of the wage determination or require submission into evidence or
disclosure of source data or the names of establishments contacted in developing the survey which is the basis for
the prevailing wage determination.

(d) The administrative law judge shall not render determinations as to the legality of a regulatory provision or
the constitutionality of a statutory provision.
(e) The decision shall be served on all parties in person or by certified or regular mail.

[65 FR 80237, Dec. 20, 2000]

§655.850 Who has custody of the administrative record?
The official record of every completed administrative hearing procedure provided by subparts H and I of this
part shall be maintained and filed under the custody and control of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. Upon

Administrative Law Judge shall certify the official record and shall transmit such record to the clerk of the court.
§655.855 What notice shall be given to the Employment and Training Administration and the DHS of the
decision regarding violations?
(a) The Administrator shall notify the DHS and ETA of the final determination of any violation requiring that
the DHS not approve petitions filed by an employer. The Administrator's notification will address the type of

(3) Where a timely petition for review is filed from an administrative law judge's decision finding a violation
and the Board either declines within 30 days to entertain the appeal, pursuant to §655.845(c), or the Board reviews

review, issues a decision pursuant to §655.845, holding that a violation was committed by an employer.
(c) The DHS, upon receipt of notification from the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section,
shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under sections 204 or 214(c) of the INA (8 U.S.C.

Subparts J-K [Reserved]
Subpart L—What Requirements Must a Facility Meet to Employ H-1C
Nonimmigrant Workers as Registered Nurses?
SOURCE: 65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
EDITORIAL NOTE: Nomenclature changes to subpart L of part 655 appear at 75 FR 10403, Mar. 5, 2010.

§655.1100 What are the purposes, procedures and applicability of these regulations in subparts L and M of
this part?
(a) Purpose. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the Nursing Relief for
Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999, establishes the H-1C nonimmigrant visa program to provide qualified nursing
professionals for narrowly defined health professional shortage areas. Subpart L of this part sets forth the procedure
by which facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant registered nurses must submit attestations to the Department of
Labor demonstrating their eligibility to participate as facilities, their wages and working conditions for nurses, their
efforts to recruit and retain United States workers as registered nurses, the absence of a strike/lockout or layoff,
notification of nurses, and the numbers of and worksites where H-1C nurses will be employed. Subpart M of this
part sets forth complaint, investigation, and penalty provisions with respect to such attestations.
(b) Procedure. The INA establishes a procedure for facilities to follow in seeking admission to the United
States for, or use of, nonimmigrant nurses under H-1C visas. The procedure is designed to reduce reliance on
nonimmigrant nurses in the future, and calls for the facility to attest, and be able to demonstrate in the course of an
investigation, that it is taking timely and significant steps to develop, recruit, and retain U.S. nurses. Subparts L and
M of this part set forth the specific requirements of those procedures.
(c) Applicability. (1) Subparts L and M of this part apply to all facilities that seek the temporary admission or
use of H-1C nonimmigrants as registered nurses.
(2) During the period that the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) apply, subparts L and M of this part shall apply to the entry of a nonimmigrant who is a
citizen of Mexico under the provisions of section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA. Therefore, the references in this part
to “H-1C nurse” apply to such nonimmigrants who are classified by USCIS as “TN.”
§655.1101 What are the responsibilities of the government agencies and the facilities that participate in the
H-1C program?
(a) Federal agencies' responsibilities. The Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Homeland Security,
and Department of State are involved in the H-1C visa process. Within DOL, the Employment and Training
Administration (ETA) and the Wage and Hour Division have responsibility for different aspects of the process.
(b) Facility's attestation responsibilities. Each facility seeking one or more H-1C nurse(s) must, as the first
step, submit an attestation on Form ETA 9081, as described in §655.1110 of this part, to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Chicago National
Processing Center, 536 South Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60605-1509. If the attestation satisfies the criteria stated in

§655.1130 and includes the supporting information required by §655.1110 and by §655.1114, ETA shall accept the
attestation form for filing, and return the accepted attestation to the facility.
(c) H-1C petitions. Upon ETA's acceptance of the attestation, the facility may then file petitions with U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the admission of, change to, or extension of status of H-1C
nurses. The facility must attach a copy of the accepted attestation (Form ETA 9081) to the petition or the request for
adjustment or extension of status, filed with USCIS. At the same time that the facility files an H-1C petition with
USCIS, it must also send a copy of the petition to the Employment and Training Administration, Administrator,
Office of Foreign Labor Certification, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210. The
facility must also send to this same ETA address a copy of the USCIS petition approval notice within 5 days after it
is received from USCIS.
(d) Visa issuance. USCIS makes determinations, in adjudicating an H-1C petition, whether the foreign worker
possesses the required qualifications and credentials to be employed as an H-1C nurse. The Department of State is
subsequently responsible for determining visa eligibility.
(e) Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) review of Attestations accepted and not accepted for
filing. Any interested party may seek review by the BALCA of an Attestation accepted or not accepted for filing by
ETA. However, such appeals are limited to ETA actions on the three Attestation matters on which ETA conducts a
substantive review (i.e., the employer's eligibility as a facility; the facility's attestation to alternative timely and
significant steps; and the facility's assertion that taking a second timely and significant step would not be
reasonable).
(f) Complaints. Complaints concerning misrepresentation of material fact(s) in the Attestation or failure of the
facility to carry out the terms of the Attestation may be filed with the Wage and Hour Division of DOL, according to
the procedures set forth in subpart M of this part. The Wage and Hour Administrator shall investigate and, where
appropriate, after an opportunity for a hearing, assess remedies and penalties. Subpart M of this part also provides
that interested parties may obtain an administrative law judge hearing and may seek review of the administrative law
judge's decision at the Department's Administrative Review Board.
[75 FR 10403, Mar. 5, 2010]

§655.1102 What are the definitions of terms that are used in these regulations?
For the purposes of subparts L and M of this part:
Accepted for filing means that the Attestation and any supporting documentation submitted by the facility have
been received by the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor and have been found to
be complete and acceptable for purposes of Attestation requirements in §§655.1110 through 655.1118.
Administrative Law Judge means an official appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105.
Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration, Department of Labor, and such authorized representatives as may be designated to perform any of
the functions of the Administrator under subparts L and M of this part.
Administrator, Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) means the primary official of the Office of
Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC Administrator), or the OFLC Administrator's designee.

misrepresentation of material fact(s) or non-compliance with the attestation;
(2) A bargaining representative for workers whose jobs, wages, or working conditions are adversely affected
by the facility's alleged misrepresentation of material fact(s) or non-compliance with the attestation;
(3) A competitor adversely affected by the facility's alleged misrepresentation of material fact(s) or noncompliance with the attestation; and

who serve on the permanent Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals established by 20 CFR part 656. BALCA
consists of administrative law judges assigned to the Department of Labor and designated by the Chief

Date of filing means the date an Attestation is “accepted for filing” by ETA.
Department and DOL mean the United States Department of Labor.

Standards Administration, DOL.
Employed or employment means the employment relationship as determined under the common law, except
that a facility which files a petition on behalf of an H-1C nonimmigrant is deemed to be the employer of that H-1C
nonimmigrant without the necessity of the application of the common law test. Under the common law, the key
determinant is the putative employer's right to control the means and manner in which the work is performed. Under
the common law, “no shorthand formula or magic phrase * * * can be applied to find the answer * * *. [A]ll of
the incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive.” NLRB v. United
Ins. Co. of America, 390 U.S. 254, 258 (1968). The determination should consider the following factors and any
other relevant factors that would indicate the existence of an employment relationship:
(1) The firm has the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job;
(2) The work does not require a high level of skill or expertise;
(3) The firm rather than the worker furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment;
(4) The work is performed on the premises of the firm or the client;
(5) There is a continuing relationship between the worker and the firm;

(6) The firm has the right to assign additional projects to the worker;

and nonprofit operations) of the firm;
(11) The firm is itself in business;
(12) The worker is not engaged in his or her own distinct occupation or business;
(13) The firm provides the worker with benefits such as insurance, leave, or workers' compensation;
(14) The worker is considered an employee of the firm for tax purposes (i.e., the entity withholds federal,
state, and Social Security taxes);
(15) The firm can discharge the worker; and
(16) The worker and the firm believe that they are creating an employer-employee relationship.
Employment and Training Administration (ETA) means the agency within the Department of Labor (DOL)
which includes the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).
Facility means a “subsection (d) hospital” (as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42
U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(1)(B)) that meets the following requirements:
(1) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a health professional shortage area (as defined in section
332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 245e)); and
(2) Based on its settled cost report filed under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)
for its cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1994—

intended employment, or have obtained a full and unrestricted (permanent) license in any state or territory of the
United States and received temporary authorization to practice as a registered nurse in the state of intended
employment; and,
(3) Be fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements
which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a registered
nurse immediately upon admission to the United States, and be authorized under such laws to be employed by the
employer. For purposes of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained immediately after the

§655.1110 What requirements are imposed in the filing of an attestation?
(a) Who may file Attestations?
(1) Any hospital which meets the definition of facility in §§655.1102 and 655.1111 may file an Attestation.
(2) ETA shall determine the hospital's eligibility as a facility through a review of this attestation element on
the first Attestation filed by the hospital. ETA's determination on this point is subject to a hearing before the
BALCA upon the request of any interested party. The BALCA proceeding shall be limited to the point.
(3) Upon the hospital's filing of a second or subsequent Attestation, its eligibility as a facility shall be
controlled by the determination made on this point in the ETA review (and BALCA proceeding, if any) of the
hospital's first Attestation.
(b) Where and when should attestations be submitted?
(1) Attestations shall be submitted, by U.S. mail or private carrier, to ETA at the following address: U.S.
Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Chicago
National Processing Center, 536 South Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60605-1509.
(2) Attestations shall be reviewed and accepted for filing or rejected by ETA within 30 calendar days of the
date they are received by ETA. Therefore, it is recommended that attestations be submitted to ETA at least 35
calendar days prior to the planned date for filing an H-1C visa petition with USCIS.
(c) What shall be submitted?
(1) Form ETA 9081 and required supporting documentation, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv)
of this section.

(i) A completed and dated original Form ETA 9081, containing the required attestation elements and the
original signature of the chief executive officer of the facility, shall be submitted, along with one copy of the
completed, signed, and dated Form ETA 9081. Copies of the form and instructions are available at the address listed
in paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) If the Attestation is the first filed by the hospital, it shall be accompanied by copies of pages from the
hospital's Form HCFA 2552 filed with the Department of Health and Human Services (pursuant to title XVIII of the
Social Security Act) for its 1994 cost reporting period, showing the number of its acute care beds and the
percentages of Medicaid and Medicare reimbursed acute care inpatient days (i.e., Form HCFA-2552-92, Worksheet
S-3, Part I; Worksheet S, Parts I and II).
(iii) If the facility attests that it will take one or more timely and significant steps other than the steps identified
on Form ETA 9081, then the facility must submit (in duplicate) an explanation of the proposed step(s) and an
explanation of how the proposed step(s) is/are of comparable significance to those set forth on the Form and in
§655.1114. (See §655.1114(b)(2)(v).)
(iv) If the facility attests that taking more than one timely and significant step is unreasonable, then the facility
must submit (in duplicate) an explanation of this attestation. (See §655.1114(c).)
(2) Filing fee of $250 per Attestation. Payment must be in the form of a check or money order, payable to the
“U.S. Department of Labor.” Remittances must be drawn on a bank or other financial institution located in the U.S.
and be payable in U.S. currency.
(3) Copies of H-1C petitions and USCIS approval notices. After ETA has approved the attestation used by the
facility to support any H-1C petition, the facility must send copies of each H-1C petition and USCIS approval notice
on such petition to Employment and Training Administration, Administrator, Office of Foreign Labor Certification,
200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210.
(d) Attestation elements. The attestation elements referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are mandated
by section 212(m)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)). Section 212(m)(2)(A) requires a prospective
employer of H-1C nurses to attest to the following:
(1) That it qualifies as a facility (See §655.1111);
(2) That employment of H-1C nurses will not adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly
employed nurses (See §655.1112);
(3) That the facility will pay the H-1C nurse the facility wage rate (See §655.1113);
(4) That the facility has taken, and is taking, timely and significant steps to recruit and retain U.S. nurses (See
§655.1114);
(5) That there is not a strike or lockout at the facility, that the employment of H-1C nurses is not intended or
designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for RNs at the facility, and that the facility did not
lay off and will not lay off a registered nurse employed by the facility 90 days before and after the date of filing a
visa petition (See §655.1115);
(6) That the facility will notify its workers and give a copy of the Attestation to every nurse employed at the
facility (See §655.1116);
(7) That no more than 33 percent of nurses employed by the facility will be H-1C nonimmigrants (See
§655.1117); and

(8) That the facility will not authorize H-1C nonimmigrants to work at a worksite not under its control, and
will not transfer an H-1C nonimmigrant from one worksite to another (See §655.1118).
[75 FR 10404, Mar. 5, 2010]

§655.1111 Element I—What hospitals are eligible to participate in the H-1C program?
(a) The first attestation element requires that the employer be a “facility” for purposes of the H-1C program, as
defined in INA Section 212(m)(6), 8 U.S.C. 1182 (2)(m)(6).
(b) A qualifying facility under that section is a “subpart (d) hospital,” as defined in Section 1886(d)(1)(B) of
the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(1)(B), which:
(1) Was located in a health professional shortage area (HPSA), as determined by the Department of Health and
Human Services, on March 31, 1997. A list of HPSAs, as of March 31, 1997, was published in the FEDERAL
REGISTER on May 30, 1997 (62 FR 29395);
(2) Had at least 190 acute care beds, as determined by its settled cost report, filed under Title XVIII of the
Social Security Act, (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), for its fiscal year 1994 cost reporting period (i.e., Form HCFA-255292, Worksheet S-3, Part I, column 1, line 8);
(3) Had at least 35% of its acute care inpatient days reimbursed by Medicare, as determined by its settled cost
report, filed under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, for its fiscal year 1994 cost reporting period (i.e., Form
HCFA-2552-92, Worksheet S-3, Part I, column 4, line 8 as a percentage of column 6, line 8); and
(4) Had at least 28% of its acute care inpatient days reimbursed by Medicaid, as determined by its settled cost
report, filed under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, for its fiscal year 1994 cost reporting period (i.e., Form
HCFA-2552-92, Worksheet S-3, Part I, column 5, line 8 as a percentage of column 6, line 8).
(c) The FEDERAL REGISTER notice containing the controlling list of HPSAs (62 FR 29395), can be found in
federal depository libraries and on the Government Printing Office Internet website at http://www.access.gpo.gov.
(d) To make a determination about information in the settled cost report, the employer shall examine its own
Worksheet S-3, Part I, Hospital and Hospital Health Care Complex Statistical Data, in the Hospital and Hospital
Health Care Complex Cost Report, Form HCFA 2552, filed for the fiscal year 1994 cost reporting period.
(e) The facility must maintain a copy of the portions of Worksheet S-3, Part I and Worksheet S, Parts I and II
of HCFA Form 2552 which substantiate the attestation of eligibility as a “facility.” One set of copies of this
document must be kept in the facility's public access file. The full Form 2552 for fiscal year 1994 must be made
available to the Department upon request.
§655.1112 Element II—What does “no adverse effect on wages and working conditions” mean?
(a) The second attestation element requires that the facility attest that “the employment of the alien will not
adversely affect the wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly employed.”
(b) For purposes of this program, “employment” is full-time employment as defined in §655.1102; part-time
employment of H-1C nurses is not authorized.
(c) Wages. To meet the requirement of no adverse effect on wages, the facility must attest that it will pay each
nurse employed by the facility at least the prevailing wage for the occupation in the geographic area. The facility
must pay the higher of the wage required under this paragraph or the wage required under §655.1113 (i.e., the third
attestation element: facility wage).

(1) Collectively bargained wage rates. Where wage rates for nurses at a facility are the result of arms-length
collective bargaining, those rates shall be considered “prevailing” for that facility for the purposes of this subpart.
(2) Determination of prevailing wage for H-1C purposes. In the absence of collectively bargained wage rates,
the National Processing Center (NPC) having jurisdiction as determined by OFLC shall determine the prevailing
wage for similarly employed nurses in the geographic area in accordance with administrative guidelines issued by
ETA for prevailing wage determination requests submitted on or after the effective date of these regulations.
(i) Prior to the effective date of these regulations, the SWA having jurisdiction over the area of intended
employment shall continue to receive and process prevailing wage determination requests in accordance with the
regulatory provisions and Department guidance in effect prior to January 1, 2009. On or after the effective date of
these regulations, the NPC shall receive and process prevailing wage determination requests in accordance with
these regulations and with Department guidance. A facility seeking to determine the prevailing wage must request a
prevailing wage determination from the NPC having jurisdiction for providing the prevailing wage over the
proposed area of intended employment not more than 90 days prior to the date the attestation is submitted to the
Department. The NPC must enter its wage determination on the form it uses and return the form with its
endorsement to the employer. Once a facility obtains a prevailing wage determination from the NPC and files an
attestation supported by that prevailing wage determination, the facility shall be deemed to have accepted the
prevailing wage determination as accurate and appropriate (as to both the occupational classification and the wage
rate) and thereafter shall not contest the legitimacy of that prevailing wage determination in an investigation or
enforcement action pursuant to subpart M of this part.
(ii) A facility may challenge the prevailing wage determination with the NPC having provided such
determination according to administrative guidelines issued by ETA, but must obtain a final ruling prior to filing an
attestation.
(3) Total compensation package. The prevailing wage under this paragraph relates to wages only. Employers
are cautioned that each item in the total compensation package for U.S. nurses, H-1C, and other nurses employed by
the facility must be the same within a given facility, including such items as housing assistance and fringe benefits.
(4) Documentation of pay and total compensation. The facility must maintain in its public access file a copy of
the prevailing wage, which shall be either the collective bargaining agreement or the determination that was
obtained from the NPC. The facility must maintain payroll records, as specified in §655.1113, and make such
records available to the Administrator in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart M.
(d) Working conditions. To meet the requirement of no adverse effect on working conditions, the facility must
attest that it will afford equal treatment to U.S. and H-1C nurses with the same seniority, with respect to such
working conditions as the number and scheduling of hours worked (including shifts, straight days, weekends);
vacations; wards and clinical rotations; and overall staffing-patient patterns. In the event of an enforcement action
pursuant to subpart M, the facility must provide evidence substantiating compliance with this attestation.
[65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 78068, Dec. 19, 2008]

§655.1113 Element III—What does “facility wage rate” mean?
(a) The third attestation element requires that the facility employing or seeking to employ the alien must attest
that “the alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the
facility.”
(b) The facility must pay the higher of the wage required in this section (i.e. facility wage), or the wage
required in §655.1112 (i.e., prevailing wage).
(c) Wage obligations for H-1C nurses in nonproductive status—(1) Circumstances where wages must be paid.
If the H-1C nurse is not performing work and is in a nonproductive status due to a decision by the facility (e.g.,

because of lack of assigned work), because the nurse has not yet received a license to work as a registered nurse, or
any other reason except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the facility is required to pay the salaried H1C nurse the full amount of the weekly salary, or to pay the hourly-wage H-1C nurse for a full-time week (40 hours
or such other number of hours as the facility can demonstrate to be full-time employment) at the applicable wage
rate.
(2) Circumstances where wages need not be paid. If an H-1C nurse experiences a period of nonproductive
status due to conditions unrelated to employment which take the nurse away from his/her duties at his/her voluntary
request and convenience (e.g., touring the U.S., caring for ill relative) or render the nonimmigrant unable to work
(e.g., maternity leave, automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the nonimmigrant), then the facility is
not obligated to pay the required wage rate during that period, provided that such period is not subject to payment
under the facility's benefit plan. Payment need not be made if there has been a bona fide termination of the
employment relationship, as demonstrated by notification to USCIS that the employment relationship has been
terminated and the petition should be canceled.
(d) Documentation. The facility must maintain documentation substantiating compliance with this attestation
element. The public access file shall contain the facility pay schedule for nurses or a description of the factors taken
into consideration by the facility in making compensation decisions for nurses, if either of these documents exists.
Categories of nursing positions not covered by the public access file documentation shall not be covered by the
Attestation, and, therefore, such positions shall not be filled or held by H-1C nurses. The facility must maintain the
payroll records, as required under the Fair Labor Standards Act at 29 CFR part 516, and make such records available
to the Administrator in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart M of this part.
§655.1114 Element IV—What are the timely and significant steps an H-1C employer must take to recruit
and retain U.S. nurses?
(a) The fourth attestation element requires that the facility attest that it “has taken and is taking timely and
significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered nurses who are United States citizens or
immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as quickly as reasonably possible the
dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses.” The facility must take at least two such steps, unless
it demonstrates that taking a second step is not reasonable. The steps described in this section shall not be considered
to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the conditions of this section. Nothing in this
subpart or subpart M of this part shall require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate
that taking a second step is not reasonable. A facility choosing to take timely and significant steps other than those
specifically described in this section must submit with its Attestation a description of the step(s) it is proposing to
take and an explanation of how the proposed step(s) are of comparable timeliness and significance to those
described in this section (See §655.1110(c)(1)(iii)). A facility claiming that a second step is unreasonable must
submit an explanation of why such second step would be unreasonable (See §655.1110(c)(1)(iv)).
(b) Descriptions of steps. Each of the actions described in this section shall be considered a significant step
reasonably designed to recruit and retain U.S. nurses. A facility choosing any of these steps shall designate such step
on Form ETA 9081, thereby attesting that its program(s) meets the regulatory requirements set forth for such step.
Section 212(m)(2)(E)(ii) of the INA provides that a violation shall be found if a facility fails to meet a condition
attested to. Thus, a facility shall be held responsible for all timely and significant steps to which it attests.
(1) Statutory steps—(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the facility or financing (or
providing participation in) a training program for registered nurses elsewhere. Training programs may include
either courses leading to a higher degree (i.e., beyond an associate or a baccalaureate degree), or continuing
education courses. If the program includes courses leading to a higher degree, they must be courses which are part of
a program accepted for degree credit by a college or university and accredited by a State Board of Nursing or a State
Board of Higher Education (or its equivalent), as appropriate. If the program includes continuing education courses,
they must be courses which meet criteria established to qualify the nurses taking the courses to earn continuing
education units accepted by a State Board of Nursing (or its equivalent). In either type of program, financing by the
facility (either directly or arranged through a third party) shall cover the total costs of such training. The number of
U.S. nurses for whom such training actually is provided shall be no less than half of the number of nurses who left

the facility during the 12-month period prior to submission of the Attestation. U.S. nurses to whom such training
was offered, but who rejected such training, may be counted towards those provided training.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become
registered nurses. This may include programs leading directly to a degree in nursing, or career ladder/career path
programs which could ultimately lead to a degree in nursing. Any such degree program shall be, at a minimum,
through an accredited community college (leading to an associate's degree), 4-year college (a bachelor's degree), or
diploma school, and the course of study must be one accredited by a State Board of Nursing (or its equivalent). The
facility (either directly or arranged through a third party) must cover the total costs of such programs. U.S. workers
participating in such programs must be working or have worked in health care occupations or facilities. The number
of U.S. workers for whom such training is provided must be equal to no less than half the average number of
vacancies for nurses during the 12-month period prior to the submission of the Attestation. U.S. nurses to whom
such training was offered, but who rejected such training, may be counted towards those provided training.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly
employed in the geographic area. The facility's entire schedule of wages for nurses shall be at least 5 percent higher
than the prevailing wage as determined by the NPC, and such differentials shall be maintained throughout the period
of the Attestation's effectiveness.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by registered nurses. This may
include salary advancement based on factors such as merit, education, and specialty, and/or salary advancement
based on length of service, with other bases for wage differentials remaining constant.
(A) Merit, education, and specialty. Salary advancement may be based on factors such as merit, education,
and specialty, or the facility may provide opportunities for professional development of its nurses which lead to
salary advancement (e.g., participation in continuing education or in-house educational instruction; service on
special committees, task forces, or projects considered of a professional development nature; participation in
professional organizations; and writing for professional publications). Such opportunities must be available to all the
facility's nurses.
(B) Length of service. Salary advancement may be based on length of service using clinical ladders which
provide, annually, salary increases of 3 percent or more for a period of no less than 10 years, over and above the
costs of living and merit, education, and specialty increases and differentials.
(2) Other possible steps. The Act indicates that the four steps described in the statute (and set out in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section) are not an exclusive list of timely and significant steps which might qualify. The actions
described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, are also deemed to be qualified; in paragraph (b)(2)(v)
of this section, the facility is afforded the opportunity to identify a timely and significant step of its own devising.
(i) Monetary incentives. The facility provides monetary incentives to nurses, through bonuses and merit pay
plans not included in the base compensation package, for additional education, and for efforts by the nurses leading
to increased recruitment and retention of U.S. nurses. Such monetary incentives may be based on actions by nurses
such as: Instituting innovations to achieve better patient care, increased productivity, reduced waste, and/or
improved workplace safety; obtaining additional certification in a nursing specialty; accruing unused sick leave;
recruiting other U.S. nurses; staying with the facility for a given number of years; taking less desirable assignments
(other than shift differential); participating in professional organizations; serving on task forces and on special
committees; or contributing to professional publications.
(ii) Special perquisites. The facility provides nurses with special perquisites for dependent care or housing
assistance of a nature and/or extent that constitute a “significant” factor in inducing employment and retention of
U.S. nurses.
(iii) Work schedule options. The facility provides nurses with non-mandatory work schedule options for parttime work, job-sharing, compressed work week or non-rotating shifts (provided, however, that H-1C nurses are

employed only in full-time work) of a nature and/or extent that constitute a “significant” factor in inducing
employment and retention of U.S. nurses.
(iv) Other training options. The facility provides training opportunities to U.S. workers not currently in health
care occupations to become registered nurses by means of financial assistance (e.g., scholarship, loan or pay-back
programs) to such persons.
(v) Alternative but significant steps. Facilities are encouraged to be innovative in devising timely and
significant steps other than those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. To qualify,
an alternative step must be of a timeliness and significance comparable to those in this section. A facility may
designate on Form ETA 9081 that it has taken and is taking such alternate step(s), thereby attesting that the step(s)
meet the statutory test of timeliness and significance comparable to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and
(b)(2)(i) through (iv) in promoting the development, recruitment, and retention of U.S. nurses. If such a designation
is made on Form ETA 9081, the submission of the Attestation to ETA must include an explanation and appropriate
documentation of the alternate step(s), and of the manner in which they satisfy the statutory test in comparison to the
steps described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) through (iv). ETA will review the explanation and documentation
and determine whether the alternate step(s) qualify under this subsection. The ETA determination is subject to
review by the BALCA, upon the request of an interested party; such review shall be limited to this matter.
(c) Unreasonableness of second step. Nothing in this subpart or subpart M of this part requires a facility to
take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable. However, a
facility shall make every effort to take at least two steps. The taking of a second step may be considered
unreasonable if it would result in the facility's financial inability to continue providing the same quality and quantity
of health care or if the provision of nursing services would otherwise be jeopardized by the taking of such a step.
(1) A facility may designate on Form ETA 9081 that the taking of a second step is not reasonable. If such a
designation is made on Form ETA 9081, the submission of the Attestation to ETA shall include an explanation and
appropriate documentation with respect to each of the steps described in paragraph (b) of this section (other than the
step designated as being taken by the facility), showing why it would be unreasonable for the facility to take each
such step and why it would be unreasonable for the facility to take any other step designed to recruit, develop and
retain sufficient U.S. nurses to meet its staffing needs.
(2) ETA will review the explanation and documentation, and will determine whether the taking of a second
step would not be reasonable. The ETA determination is subject to review by the BALCA, upon the request of an
interested party; such review shall be limited to this matter.
(d) Performance-based alternative to criteria for specific steps. Instead of complying with the specific criteria
for one or more of the steps in the second and/or succeeding years of participation in the H-1C program, a facility
may include in its prior year's Attestation, in addition to the actions taken under specifically attested steps, that it
will reduce the number of H-1C nurses it utilizes within one year from the date of the Attestation by at least 10
percent, without reducing the quality or quantity of services provided. If this goal is achieved, the facility shall so
indicate on its subsequent year's Attestation. Further, the facility need not attest to any “timely and significant step”
on that subsequent attestation, if it again indicates that it shall again reduce the number of H-1C nurses it utilizes
within one year from the date of the Attestation by at least 10 percent. This performance-based alternative is
designed to permit a facility to achieve the objectives of the Act, without subjecting the facility to detailed
requirements and criteria as to the specific means of achieving that objective.
(e) Documentation. The facility must include in the public access file a description of the activities which
constitute its compliance with each timely and significant step which is attested on Form ETA 9081 (e.g., summary
of a training program for registered nurses; description of a career ladder showing meaningful opportunities for pay
advancements for nurses). If the facility has attested that it will take an alternative step or that taking a second step is
unreasonable, then the public access file must include the documentation which was submitted to ETA under
paragraph (c) of this section. The facility must maintain in its non-public files, and must make available to the
Administrator in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart M of this part, documentation which

provides a complete description of the nature and operation of its program(s) sufficient to substantiate its full
compliance with the requirements of each timely and significant step which is attested to on Form ETA 9081. This
documentation should include information relating to all of the requirements for the step in question.
§655.1115 Element V—What does “no strike/lockout or layoff” mean?
(a) The fifth attestation element requires that the facility attest that “there is not a strike or lockout in the
course of a labor dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a registered nurse employed by the facility
within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition, and the
employment of such an alien is not intended or designated to influence an election for a bargaining representative
for registered nurses of the facility.” Labor disputes for purposes of this attestation element relate only to those
involving nurses providing nursing services; other health service occupations are not included. A facility which has
filed a petition for H-1C nurses is also prohibited from interfering with the right of the nonimmigrant to join or
organize a union.
(b) Notice of strike or lockout. In order to remain in compliance with the no strike or lockout portion of this
attestation element, the facility must notify ETA if a strike or lockout of nurses at the facility occurs during the 1
year validity period of the attestation. Within 3 days of the occurrence of such strike or lockout, the facility must
submit to the Administrator, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration,
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210, by U.S. mail or
private carrier, written notice of the strike or lockout. Upon receiving a notice described in this section from a
facility, ETA will examine the documentation, and may consult with the union at the facility or other appropriate
entities. If ETA determines that the strike or lockout is covered under USCIS regulation 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17), Effect
of a strike, for “H” nonimmigrants, ETA must certify to USCIS, in the manner set forth in that regulation, that a
strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of nurses is in progress at the facility.
(c) Lay off of a U.S. nurse means that the employer has caused the nurse's loss of employment in
circumstances other than where—
(1) A U.S. nurse has been discharged for inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, or other
reasonable work-related cause;
(2) A U.S. nurse's departure or retirement is voluntary (to be assessed in light of the totality of the
circumstances, under established principles concerning “constructive discharge” of workers who are pressured to
leave employment);
(3) The grant or contract under which the work performed by the U.S. nurse is required and funded has
expired, and without such grant or contract the nurse would not continue to be employed because there is no
alternative funding or need for the position; or
(4) A U.S. nurse who loses employment is offered, as an alternative to such loss, a similar employment
opportunity with the same employer. The validity of the offer of a similar employment opportunity will be assessed
in light of the following factors:
(i) The offer is a bona fide offer, rather than an offer designed to induce the U.S. nurse to refuse or an offer
made with the expectation that the worker will refuse;
(ii) The offered job provides the U.S. nurse an opportunity similar to that provided in the job from which
he/she is discharged, in terms such as a similar level of authority, discretion, and responsibility, a similar opportunity
for advancement within the organization, and similar tenure and work scheduling;
(iii) The offered job provides the U.S. nurse equivalent or higher compensation and benefits to those provided
in the job from which he/she is discharged.

(d) Documentation. The facility must include in its public access file, copies of all notices of strikes or other
labor disputes involving a work stoppage of nurses at the facility (submitted to ETA under paragraph (b) of this
section). The facility must retain in its non-public files, and make available in the event of an enforcement action
pursuant to subpart M of this part, any existing documentation with respect to the departure of each U.S. nurse who
left his/her employment with the facility in the period from 90 days before until 90 days after the facility's petition
for H-1C nurse(s). The facility is also required to have a record of the terms of any offer of alternative employment
to such a U.S. nurse and the nurse's response to the offer (which may be a note to the file or other record of the
nurse's response), and to make such record available in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart M.

§655.1116 Element VI—What notification must facilities provide to registered nurses?
(a) The sixth attestation element requires the facility to attest that at the time of filing of the petition for
registered nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the INA, notice of filing has been provided by the facility to
the bargaining representative of the registered nurses at the facility or, where there is no such bargaining
representative, notice of the filing has been provided to registered nurses at the facility through posting in
conspicuous locations, and individual copies of the Attestation have been provided to registered nurses employed at
the facility.
(b) Notification of bargaining representative. (1) At a time no later than the date the attestation is transmitted
to ETA, on ETA Form 9081, Attestation for H-1C Nonimmigrant Nurses, the facility must notify the bargaining
representative (if any) for nurses at the facility that the attestation is being submitted. This notice may be either a
copy of the attestation (ETA Form 9081) or a document stating that the attestations are available for review by
interested parties at the facility (explaining how they can be inspected or obtained) and at the Office of Foreign
Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,
NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210. The notice must include the following statement: “Complaints
alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation
may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor.”
(2) No later than the date the facility transmits a petition for H-1C nurses to USCIS, the facility must notify
the bargaining representative (if any) for nurses at the facility that the H-1C petition is being submitted. This notice
may be either a copy of petition, or a document stating that the attestations and H-1C petition are available for
review by interested parties at the facility (explaining how they can be inspected or obtained) and at the Office of
Foreign Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room C-4312, Washington, DC 20210. The notice must include the following statement:
“Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation or failure to comply with the terms of the
attestation may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor.”
(c) Posting notice. If there is no bargaining representative for nurses at the facility, the facility must post a
written notice in two or more conspicuous locations at the facility. Such notices shall be clearly visible and
unobstructed while posted, and shall be posted in conspicuous places where nurses can easily read the notices on
their way to or from their duties. Appropriate locations for posting hard copy notices include locations in the
immediate proximity of mandatory Fair Labor Standards Act wage and hour notices and Occupational Safety and
Health Act occupational safety and health notices. In the alternative, the facility may use electronic means it
ordinarily uses to communicate with its nurses about job vacancies or promotion opportunities, including through its
“home page” or “electronic bulletin board,” provided that the nurses have, as a practical matter, direct access to
those sites; or, where the nurses have individual e-mail accounts, the facility may use e-mail. This must be
accomplished no later than the date when the facility transmits an Attestation to ETA and the date when the facility
transmits an H-1C petition to the USCIS. The notice may be either a copy of the Attestation or petition, or a
document stating that the Attestation or petition has been filed and is available for review by interested parties at the
facility (explaining how these documents can be inspected or obtained) and at the national office of ETA. The notice
shall include the following statement: “Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the Attestation or
failure to comply with the terms of the Attestation may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of
the United States Department of Labor.” Unless it is sent to an individual e-mail address, the Attestation notice shall

remain posted during the validity period of the Attestation; the petition notice shall remain posted for ten days.
Copies of all notices shall be available for examination in the facility's public access file.
(d) Individual notice to RNs. In addition to notifying the bargaining representative or posting notice as
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the facility must provide a copy of the Attestation, within 30 days
of the date of filing, to every registered nurse employed at the facility. This requirement may be satisfied by
electronic means if an individual e-mail message, with the Attestation as an attachment, is sent to every RN at the
facility. This notification includes not only the RNs employed by the facility, but also includes any RN who is
providing service at the facility as an employee of another entity, such as a nursing contractor.
(e) Where RNs lack practical computer access, a hard copy must be posted in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this section and a hard copy of the Attestation delivered, within 30 days of the date of filing, to every RN employed
at the facility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(f) The facility must maintain, in its public access file, copies of the notices required by this section. The
facility must make such documentation available to the Administrator in the event of an enforcement action pursuant
to subpart M of this part.
[65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 10405, Mar. 5, 2010]

§655.1117 Element VII—What are the limitations as to the number of H-1C nonimmigrants that a facility
may employ?
(a) The seventh attestation element requires that the facility attest that it will not, at any time, employ a
number of H-1C nurses that exceeds 33% of the total number of registered nurses employed by the facility. The
calculation of the population of nurses for purposes of this attestation includes only nurses who have an employeremployee relationship with the facility (as defined in §655.1102).
(b) The facility must maintain documentation (e.g., payroll records, copies of H-1C petitions) that
demonstrates its compliance with this attestation. The facility must make such documentation available to the
Administrator in the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart M of this part.
§655.1118 Element VIII—What are the limitations as to where the H-1C nonimmigrant may be employed?
The eighth attestation element requires that the facility attest that it will not authorize any H-1C nurse to
perform services at any worksite not controlled by the facility or transfer any H-1C nurse from one worksite to
another worksite, even if all of the worksites are controlled by the facility.
§655.1130 What criteria does the Department use to determine whether or not to certify an Attestation?
(a) An Attestation form which is complete and has no obvious inaccuracies will be accepted for filing by ETA
without substantive review, except that ETA will conduct a substantive review on particular attestation elements in
the following limited circumstances:
(1) Determination of whether the hospital submitting the Attestation is a qualifying “facility” (see
§655.1110(c)(ii), regarding the documentation required, and the process for review);
(2) Where the facility attests that it is taking or will take a “timely and significant step” other than those
identified on the Form ETA 9081 (see §655.1114(b)(2)(v), regarding the documentation required, and the process
for review);
(3) Where the facility asserts that taking a second “timely and significant step” is unreasonable (see
§655.1114(c), regarding the documentation required, and the process for review).

(b) The certifying officer will act on the Attestation in a timely manner. If the officer does not contact the
facility for information or make any determination within 30 days of receiving the Attestation, the Attestation shall
be accepted for filing. If ETA receives information contesting the truth of the statements attested to or compliance
with an Attestation prior to the determination to accept or reject the Attestation for filing, such information shall not
be made part of ETA's administrative record on the Attestation but shall be referred to the Administrator to be
processed as a complaint pursuant to subpart M of this part if such Attestation is accepted by ETA for filing.
(c) When the facility submits the attestation to ETA and provides the notice required by §655.1116, the
attestation must be made available for public examination at the facility. When ETA accepts the attestation for
filing, the attestation will be made available, upon request, for public examination in the Office of Foreign Labor
Certification, Employment Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Room C-4312, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.
(d) Standards for acceptance of Attestation. ETA will accept the Attestation for filing under the following
standards:
(1) The Attestation is complete and contains no obvious inaccuracies.
(2) The facility's explanation and documentation are sufficient to satisfy the requirements for the Attestation
elements on which substantive review is conducted (as described in paragraph (a) of this section).
(3) The facility has no outstanding “insufficient funds” check(s) in connection with filing fee(s) for prior
Attestation(s).
(4) The facility has no outstanding civil money penalties and/or has not failed to satisfy a remedy assessed by
the Wage and Hour Administrator, under subpart M of this part, where that penalty or remedy assessment has
become the final agency action.
(5) The facility has not been disqualified from approval of any petitions filed by, or on behalf of, the facility
under section 204 or section 212(m) of the INA.
(e) DOL not the guarantor. DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or adequacy of an
Attestation accepted for filing.
(f) Attestation Effective and Expiration Dates. An Attestation becomes filed and effective as of the date it is
accepted and signed by the ETA certifying officer. Such Attestation is valid until the date that is the later of the end
of the 12-month period beginning on the date of acceptance for filing with the Secretary, or the end of the period of
admission (under INA section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c)) of the last alien with respect to whose admission the Attestation
was applied, unless the Attestation is suspended or invalidated earlier than such date pursuant to §655.1132.
[65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 10406, Mar. 5, 2010]

§655.1132 When will the Department suspend or invalidate an approved Attestation?
(a) Suspension or invalidation of an Attestation may result where: the facility's check for the filing fee is not
honored by a financial institution; a Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) decision reverses an ETA
certification of the Attestation; ETA finds that it made an error in its review and certification of the Attestation; an
enforcement proceeding has finally determined that the facility failed to meet a condition attested to, or that there
was a misrepresentation of material fact in an Attestation; the facility has failed to pay civil money penalties and/or
failed to satisfy a remedy assessed by the Wage and Hour Administrator, where that penalty or remedy assessment
has become the final agency action. If an Attestation is suspended or invalidated, ETA will notify USCIS.

(b) BALCA decision or final agency action in an enforcement proceeding. If an Attestation is suspended or
invalidated as a result of a BALCA decision overruling an ETA acceptance of the Attestation for filing, or is
suspended or invalidated as a result of an enforcement action by the Administrator under subpart M of this part, such
suspension or invalidation may not be separately appealed, but shall be merged with appeals on the underlying
matter.
(c) ETA action. If, after accepting an Attestation for filing, ETA discovers that it erroneously accepted that
Attestation for filing and, as a result, ETA suspends or invalidates that acceptance, the facility may appeal such
suspension or invalidation under §655.1135 as if that suspension or invalidation were a decision to reject the
Attestation for filing.
(d) A facility must comply with the terms of its Attestation, even if such Attestation is suspended, invalidated
or expired, as long as any H-1C nurse is at the facility, unless the Attestation is superseded by a subsequent
Attestation accepted for filing by ETA.
§655.1135 What appeals procedures are available concerning ETA's actions on a facility's Attestation?
(a) Appeals of acceptances or rejections. Any interested party may appeal ETA's acceptance or rejection of an
Attestation submitted by a facility for filing. However, such an appeal shall be limited to ETA's determination on
one or more of the attestation elements for which ETA conducts a substantive review (as described in §655.1130(a)).
Such appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the acceptance or rejection, and will be considered
under the procedures set forth at paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
(b) Appeal of invalidation or suspension. An interested party may appeal ETA's invalidation or suspension of
a filed Attestation due to a discovery by ETA that it made an error in its review of the Attestation, as described in
§655.1132.
(c) Parties to the appeal. In the case of an appeal of an acceptance, the facility will be a party to the appeal; in
the case of the appeal of a rejection, invalidation, or suspension, the collective bargaining representative (if any)
representing nurses at the facility shall be a party to the appeal. Appeals shall be in writing; shall set forth the
grounds for the appeal; shall state if de novo consideration by BALCA is requested; and shall be mailed by certified
mail within 30 calendar days of the date of the action from which the appeal is taken (i.e., the acceptance, rejection,
suspension or invalidation of the Attestation).
(d) Where to file appeals. Appeals made under this section must be in writing and must be mailed by certified
mail to: U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Foreign Labor
Certification, Chicago National Processing Center, 536 South Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60605-1509.
(e) Transmittal of the case file to BALCA. Upon receipt of an appeal under this section, the Certifying Office
shall send to BALCA a certified copy of the ETA case file, containing the Attestation and supporting documentation
and any other information or data considered by ETA in taking the action being appealed. The administrative law
judge chairing BALCA shall assign a panel of one or more administrative law judges who serve on BALCA to
review the record for legal sufficiency and to consider and rule on the appeal.
(f) Consideration on the record; de novo hearings. BALCA may not remand, dismiss, or stay the case, except
as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, but may otherwise consider the appeal on the record or in a de novo
hearing (on its own motion or on a party's request). Interested parties and amici curiae may submit briefs in
accordance with a schedule set by BALCA. The ETA official who made the determination which was appealed will
be represented by the Associate Solicitor for Employment and Training Legal Services, Office of the Solicitor,
Department of Labor, or the Associate Solicitor's designee. If BALCA determines to hear the appeal on the record
without a de novo hearing, BALCA shall render a decision within 30 calendar days after BALCA's receipt of the
case file. If BALCA determines to hear the appeal through a de novo hearing, the procedures contained in 29 CFR
part 18 will apply to such hearings, except that:

(1) The appeal will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is required.
(2) BALCA shall ensure that, at the request of the appellant, the hearing is scheduled to take place within a
reasonable period after BALCA's receipt of the case file (see also the time period described in paragraph (f)(4) of
this section).
(3) Technical rules of evidence, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence and subpart B of the Rules of Practice
and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges (29 CFR part 18,
subpart B), will not apply to any hearing conducted pursuant to this subpart, but rules or principles designed to
assure production of the most credible evidence available, and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination,
shall be applied where reasonably necessary by BALCA in conducting the hearing. BALCA may exclude irrelevant,
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. The certified copy of the case file transmitted to BALCA by the
Certifying Officer must be made part of the evidentiary record of the case and need not be moved into evidence.
(4) BALCA's decision shall be rendered within 120 calendar days after BALCA's receipt of the case file.
(g) Dismissals and stays. If BALCA determines that the appeal is solely a question of misrepresentation by the
facility or is solely a complaint of the facility's nonperformance of the Attestation, BALCA shall dismiss the case
and refer the matter to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, for action under subpart M. If BALCA
determines that the appeal is partially a question of misrepresentation by the facility, or is partially a complaint of
the facility's nonperformance of the Attestation, BALCA shall refer the matter to the Administrator, Wage and Hour
Division, for action under subpart M of this part and shall stay BALCA consideration of the case pending final
agency action on such referral. During such stay, the 120-day period described in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section
shall be suspended.
(h) BALCA's decision. After consideration on the record or a de novo hearing, BALCA shall either affirm or
reverse ETA's decision, and shall so notify the appellant; and any other parties.
(i) Decisions on Attestations. With respect to an appeal of the acceptance, rejection, suspension or invalidation
of an Attestation, the decision of BALCA shall be the final decision of the Secretary, and no further review shall be
given to the matter by any DOL official.
[65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 10406, Mar. 5, 2010]

§655.1150 What materials must be available to the public?
(a) Public examination at ETA. ETA will make available, upon request, for public examination at the Office of
Foreign Labor Certification, Employment Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Room C-4312, 200
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, a list of facilities which have filed attestations; a copy of the
facility's attestation(s) and any supporting documentation; and a copy of each of the facility's H-1C petitions (if any)
to USCIS along with the USCIS approval notices (if any).
(b) Public examination at facility. For the duration of the Attestation's validity and thereafter for so long as the
facility employs any H-1C nurse under the Attestation, the facility must maintain a separate file containing a copy of
the Attestation, a copy of the prevailing wage determination, a description of the facility pay system or a copy of the
facility's pay schedule if either document exists, copies of the notices provided under §655.1115 and §655.1116, a
description of the “timely and significant steps” as described in §655.1114, and any other documentation required by
this part to be contained in the public access file. The facility must make this file available to any interested parties
within 72 hours upon written or oral request. If a party requests a copy of the file, the facility shall provide it and any
charge for such copy shall not exceed the cost of reproduction.
(c) ETA Notice to public. ETA will periodically publish a notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER announcing the
names and addresses of facilities which have submitted Attestations; facilities which have Attestations on file;

facilities which have submitted Attestations which have been rejected for filing; and facilities which have had
Attestations suspended.
[65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 10406, Mar. 5, 2010]

Subpart M—What are the Department's enforcement obligations with respect to
H-1C Attestations?
SOURCE: 65 FR 51149, Aug. 22, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
EDITORIAL NOTE: Nomenclature changes to subpart M of part 655 appear at 75 FR 10403, Mar. 5, 2010.

§655.1200 What enforcement authority does the Department have with respect to a facility's H-1C
Attestations?
(a) The Administrator shall perform all the Secretary's investigative and enforcement functions under 8 U.S.C.
1182(m) and subparts L and M of this part.
(b) The Administrator, either because of a complaint or otherwise, shall conduct such investigations as may be
appropriate and, in connection therewith, enter and inspect such places and such records (and make transcriptions
thereof), question such persons and gather such information as deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine
compliance with the matters to which a facility has attested under section 212(m) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(m))
and subparts L and M of this part.
(c) A facility being investigated must make available to the Administrator such records, information, persons,
and places as the Administrator deems appropriate to copy, transcribe, question, or inspect. A facility must fully
cooperate with any official of the Department of Labor performing an investigation, inspection, or law enforcement
function under 8 U.S.C. 1182(m) or subparts L or M of this part. Such cooperation shall include producing
documentation upon request. The Administrator may deem the failure to cooperate to be a violation, and take such
further actions as the Administrator considers appropriate.
(NOTE: Federal criminal statutes prohibit certain interference with a Federal officer in the performance of official duties.
18 U.S.C. 111 and 1114.)

(d) No facility may intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any manner discriminate
against any person because such person has:
(1) Filed a complaint or appeal under or related to section 212(m) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(m)) or subpart L
or M of this part;
(2) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to section 212(m) of the INA (8 U.S.C.
1182(m)) or subpart L or M of this part.
(3) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself/herself or others any right or protection afforded by section
212(m) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(m)) or subpart L or M of this part.
(4) Consulted with an employee of a legal assistance program or an attorney on matters related to the Act or to
subparts L or M of this part or any other DOL regulation promulgated under 8 U.S.C. 1182(m).
(5) In the event of such intimidation or restraint as are described in this paragraph, the Administrator may
deem the conduct to be a violation and take such further actions as the Administrator considers appropriate.

(e) A facility subject to subparts L and M of this part must maintain a separate file containing its Attestation
and required documentation, and must make that file or copies thereof available to interested parties, as required by
§655.1150. In the event of a facility's failure to maintain the file, to provide access, or to provide copies, the
Administrator may deem the conduct to be a violation and take such further actions as the Administrator considers
appropriate.
(f) No facility may seek to have an H-1C nurse, or any other nurse similarly employed by the employer, or any
other employee waive rights conferred under the Act or under subpart L or M of this part. In the event of such
waiver, the Administrator may deem the conduct to be a violation and take such further actions as the Administrator
considers appropriate. This prohibition of waivers does not prevent agreements to settle litigation among private
parties, and a waiver or modification of rights or obligations in favor of the Secretary shall be valid for purposes of
enforcement of the provisions of the Act or subpart L and M of this part.
(g) The Administrator shall, to the extent possible under existing law, protect the confidentiality of any
complainant or other person who provides information to the Department.
§655.1205 What is the Administrator's responsibility with respect to complaints and investigations?
(a) The Administrator, through investigation, shall determine whether a facility has failed to perform any
attested conditions, misrepresented any material facts in an Attestation (including misrepresentation as to
compliance with regulatory standards), or otherwise violated the Act or subpart L or M of this part. The
Administrator's authority applies whether an Attestation is expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(Note: Federal criminal statutes provide for fines and/or imprisonment for knowing and willful submission of false
statements to the Federal Government. 18 U.S.C. 1001; see also 18 U.S.C. 1546.)
(b) Any aggrieved person or organization may file a complaint of a violation of the provisions of section
212(m) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(m)) or subpart L or M of this part. No particular form of complaint is required,
except that the complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division
official who receives the complaint. The complaint must set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine
what part or parts of the Attestation or regulations have allegedly been violated. Upon the request of the
complainant, the Administrator shall, to the extent possible under existing law, maintain confidentiality about the
complainant's identity; if the complainant wishes to be a party to the administrative hearing proceedings under this
subpart, the complainant shall then waive confidentiality. The complaint may be submitted to any local Wage and
Hour Division office; the addresses of such offices are found in local telephone directories. Inquiries concerning the
enforcement program and requests for technical assistance regarding compliance may also be submitted to the local
Wage and Hour Division office.
(c) The Administrator shall determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint warrants
investigation and, if so, shall conduct an investigation, within 180 days of the receipt of a complaint. If the
Administrator determines that the complaint fails to present reasonable cause for an investigation, the Administrator
shall so notify the complainant, who may submit a new complaint, with such additional information as may be
necessary.
(d) When an investigation has been conducted, the Administrator shall, within 180 days of the receipt of a
complaint, issue a written determination, stating whether a basis exists to make a finding that the facility failed to
meet a condition of its Attestation, made a misrepresentation of a material fact therein, or otherwise violated the Act
or subpart L or M. The determination shall specify any sanctions imposed due to violations. The Administrator shall
provide a notice of such determination to the interested parties and shall inform them of the opportunity for a
hearing pursuant to §655.1220.
§655.1210 What penalties and other remedies may the Administrator impose?
(a) The Administrator may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per violation, with the
total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation. The Administrator also may impose appropriate remedies,

including the payment of back wages, the performance of attested obligations such as providing training, and
reinstatement and/or wages for laid off U.S. nurses.
(b) In determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed for any violation, the Administrator will
consider the type of violation committed and other relevant factors. The matters which may be considered include,
but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation, or violations, by the facility under the Act and subpart L or M of this part;
(2) The number of workers affected by the violation or violations;
(3) The gravity of the violation or violations;
(4) Efforts made by the violator in good faith to comply with the Attestation as provided in the Act and
subparts L and M of this part;
(5) The violator's explanation of the violation or violations;
(6) The violator's commitment to future compliance, taking into account the public health, interest, or safety;
and
(7) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation, or the potential financial
loss or potential injury or adverse effect upon the workers.
(c) The civil money penalty, back wages, and any other remedy determined by the Administrator to be
appropriate, are immediately due for payment or performance upon the assessment by the Administrator, or the
decision by an administrative law judge where a hearing is requested, or the decision by the Secretary where review
is granted. The facility must remit the amount of the civil money penalty, by certified check or money order made
payable to the order of “Wage and Hour Division, Labor.” The remittance must be delivered or mailed to the Wage
and Hour Division Regional Office for the area in which the violation(s) occurred. The payment of back wages,
monetary relief, and/or the performance or any other remedy prescribed by the Administrator will follow procedures
established by the Administrator. The facility's failure to pay the civil money penalty, back wages, or other monetary
relief, or to perform any other assessed remedy, will result in the rejection by ETA of any future Attestation
submitted by the facility until such payment or performance is accomplished.
(d) The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires
that inflationary adjustments to civil money penalties in accordance with a specified cost-of-living formula be made,
by regulation, at least every four years. The adjustments are to be based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for
all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average for All Items. The adjusted amounts will be published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER. The amount of the penalty in a particular case will be based on the amount of the penalty in
effect at the time the violation occurs.
§655.1215 How are the Administrator's investigation findings issued?
(a) The Administrator's determination, issued under §655.1205(d), shall be served on the complainant, the
facility, and other interested parties by personal service or by certified mail at the parties' last known addresses.
Where service by certified mail is not accepted by the party, the Administrator may exercise discretion to serve the
determination by regular mail. Where the complainant has requested confidentiality, the Administrator shall serve
the determination in a manner which will not breach that confidentiality.
(b) The Administrator's written determination required by §655.1205(c) shall:

(1) Set forth the determination of the Administrator and the reason or reasons therefore; prescribe any
remedies or penalties including the amount of any unpaid wages due, the actions required for compliance with the
facility Attestation, and the amount of any civil money penalty assessment and the reason or reasons therefore.
(2) Inform the interested parties that they may request a hearing under §655.1220.
(3) Inform the interested parties that if a request for a hearing is not received by the Chief Administrative Law
Judge within 15 days of the date of the determination, the determination of the Administrator shall become final and
not appealable.
(4) Set forth the procedure for requesting a hearing, and give the address of the Chief Administrative Law
Judge.
(5) Inform the parties that, under §655.1255, the Administrator shall notify the Department of Homeland
Security and ETA of the occurrence of a violation by the employer.

Judge issues an order affirming the decision.
(b) An interested party may request a hearing in the following circumstances:
(1) Where the Administrator determines that there is no basis for a finding of violation, the complainant or
other interested party may request a hearing. In such a proceeding, the party requesting the hearing shall be the

amicus curiae at any time in the proceeding, at the Administrator's discretion.
(2) Where the Administrator determines that there is a basis for a finding of violation, the facility or other
interested party may request a hearing. In such a proceeding, the Administrator shall be the prosecuting party and
the facility shall be the respondent.
(c) No particular form is prescribed for any request for hearing permitted by this part. However, any such
request shall:
(1) Be dated;
(2) Be typewritten or legibly written;
(3) Specify the issue or issues stated in the notice of determination giving rise to such request;

compelling reasons and by consent of all the parties to the proceeding.
(d) The administrative law judge may prescribe a schedule by which the parties are permitted to file a prehearing brief or other written statement of fact or law. Any such brief or statement shall be served upon each other
party in accordance with §655.1230. Posthearing briefs will not be permitted except at the request of the
administrative law judge. When permitted, any such brief shall be limited to the issue or issues specified by the

(a) The Administrator shall notify the Department of Homeland Security and ETA of the final determination
of a violation by a facility upon the earliest of the following events:
(1) Where the Administrator determines that there is a basis for a finding of violation by a facility, and no
timely request for hearing is made under §655.1220; or

Subpart N—Labor Certification Process for Temporary Agricultural
Employment in the United States (H-2A Workers)
SOURCE: 73 FR 77207, Dec. 18, 2008, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 74 FR 25985, May 29, 2009.
EFFECTIVE DATE NOTE: At 74 FR 25985, May 29, 2009, subpart B, consisting of §§655.90, 655.92, 655.93, and 655.100
through 655.119, was redesignated as subpart N, consisting of §§655.1290, 655.1292, 655.1293, and 655.1300 through 655.1319,
and newly designated subpart N was suspended, effective June 29, 2009.

§655.1290 Purpose and scope of subpart B.
This subpart sets out the procedures established by the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor
(the Secretary) to acquire information sufficient to make factual determinations of:
(a) Whether there are sufficient able, willing, and qualified U.S. workers available to perform the temporary
and seasonal agricultural employment for which an employer desires to import nonimmigrant foreign workers (H2A workers); and
(b) Whether the employment of H-2A workers will adversely affect the wages and working conditions of
workers in the U.S. similarly employed.
§655.1292 Authority of ETA-OFLC.
Temporary agricultural labor certification determinations are made by the Administrator, Office of Foreign
Labor Certification (OFLC) in the Department of Labor's (the Department or DOL) Employment & Training
Administration (ETA), who, in turn, may delegate this responsibility to a designated staff member; e.g., a Certifying
Officer (CO).

§655.1293 Special procedures.
(a) Systematic process. This subpart provides procedures for the processing of applications from agricultural
employers and associations of employers for the certification of employment of nonimmigrant workers in
agricultural employment.
(b) Establishment of special procedures. To provide for a limited degree of flexibility in carrying out the
Secretary's responsibilities under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), while not deviating from statutory
requirements, the Administrator, OFLC has the authority to establish or to devise, continue, revise, or revoke special
procedures in the form of variances for processing certain H-2A applications when employers can demonstrate upon
written application to the Administrator, OFLC that special procedures are necessary. These include special
procedures in effect for the handling of applications for sheepherders in the Western States (and adaptation of such
procedures to occupations in the range production of other livestock), and for custom combine crews. In a like
manner, for work in occupations characterized by other than a reasonably regular workday or workweek, such as the
range production of sheep or other livestock, the Administrator, OFLC has the authority to establish monthly,
weekly, or bi-weekly adverse effect wage rates (AEWR) for those occupations for a statewide or other geographical
area. Prior to making determinations under this section, the Administrator, OFLC will consult with employer and
worker representatives.
§655.1300 Overview of subpart B and definition of terms.
(a) Overview—(1) Application filing process. (i) This subpart provides guidance to employers desiring to
apply for a labor certification for the employment of H-2A workers to perform agricultural employment of a
temporary or seasonal nature. The regulations in this subpart provide that such employers must file with the
Administrator, OFLC an H-2A application on forms prescribed by the ETA that describe the material terms and
conditions of employment to be offered and afforded to U.S. and H-2A workers. The application must be filed with
the Administrator, OFLC at least 45 calendar days before the first date the employer requires the services of the H2A workers. The application must contain attestations of the employer's compliance or promise to comply with
program requirements regarding recruitment of eligible U.S. workers, the payment of an appropriate wage, and
terms and conditions of employment.
(ii) No more than 75 and no fewer than 60 calendar days before the first date the employer requires the
services of the H-2A workers, and as a precursor to the filing of an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, the employer must initiate positive recruitment of eligible U.S. workers and cooperate with the local
office of the State Workforce Agency (SWA) which serves the area of intended employment to place a job order
into intrastate and interstate recruitment. Prior to commencing recruitment an employer must obtain the appropriate
wage for the position directly from the ETA National Processing Center (NPC). The employer must then place a job
order with the SWA; place print advertisements meeting the requirements of this regulation; contact former U.S.
employees; and, when so designated by the Secretary, recruit in other States of traditional or expected labor supply
with a significant number of U.S. workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available at the
time and place needed. The SWA will post the job order locally, as well as in all States listed in the application as
anticipated work sites, and in any additional States designated by the Secretary as States of traditional or expected
labor supply. The SWA will keep the job order open until the end of the designated recruitment period. No more
than 50 days prior to the first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, the employer will prepare
and sign an initial written recruitment report that it must submit with its Application for Temporary Employment
Certification (www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov). The recruitment report must contain information regarding the
original number of openings for which the employer recruited. The employer's obligation to engage in positive
recruitment will end on the actual date on which the H-2A workers depart for the place of work, or 3 days prior to
the first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, whichever occurs first.
(iii) The Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be filed by mail unless the Department
publishes a Notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER requiring that applications be filed electronically. Applications that
meet threshold requirements for completeness and accuracy will be processed by NPC staff, who will review each
application for compliance with the criteria for certification. Each application must meet requirements for timeliness
and temporary need and must provide assurances and other safeguards against adverse impact on the wages and

working conditions of U.S. workers. Employers receiving a labor certification must continue to cooperate with the
SWA by accepting referrals—and have the obligation to hire qualified and eligible U.S. workers who apply—until
the end of the designated recruitment period.
(2) Deficient applications. The CO will promptly review the application and notify the applicant in writing if
there are deficiencies that render the application not acceptable for certification, and afford the applicant a 5
calendar day period (from date of the employer's receipt) to resubmit a modified application or to file an appeal of
the CO's decision not to approve the application as acceptable for consideration. Modified applications that fail to
cure deficiencies will be denied.
(3) Amendment of applications. This subpart provides for the amendment of applications. Where the
recruitment is not materially affected by such amendments, additional positive recruitment will not be required.
(4) Determinations—(i) Determinations. If the employer has complied with the criteria for certification,
including recruitment of eligible U.S. workers, the CO must make a determination on the application by 30 days
before the first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers. An employer's failure to comply with
any of the certification criteria or to cure deficiencies identified by the CO may lengthen the time required for
processing, resulting in a final determination less than 30 days prior to the stated date of need.
(ii) Certified applications. This subpart provides that an application for temporary agricultural labor
certification will be certified if the CO finds that the employer has not offered and does not intend to offer foreign
workers higher wages, better working conditions, or fewer restrictions than those offered and afforded to U.S.
workers; that sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and eligible will not be available at the time
and place needed to perform the work for which H-2A workers are being requested; and that the employment of
such nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S.
workers.
(iii) Fees—(A) Amount. This subpart provides that each employer (except joint employer associations) of H2A workers will pay the appropriate fees to the Department for each temporary agricultural labor certification
received.
(B) Timeliness of payment. The fee must be received by the CO no later than 30 calendar days after the
granting of each temporary agricultural labor certification. Fees received any later are untimely. A persistent or
prolonged failure to pay fees in a timely manner is a substantial program violation which may result in the denial of
future temporary agricultural labor certifications and/or program debarment.
(iv) Denied applications. This subpart provides that if the application for temporary agricultural labor
certification is denied, in whole or in part, the employer may seek expedited review of the denial, or a de novo
hearing, by an administrative law judge as provided in this subpart.
(b) Transition of filing procedures from current regulations—(1) Compliance with these regulations.
Employers with a date of need for H-2A workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural services on or after January
1, 2010 must comply with all of the obligations and assurances required in this subpart.
(2) Transition from former regulations. Employers with a date of need for H-2A workers for temporary or
seasonal agricultural services prior to January 1, 2010 will file applications in the following manner:
(i) Obtaining required wage rate. An employer will not obtain an offered wage rate through the NPC prior to
filing an application, but will complete and submit Form ETA-9142, Application for Temporary Employment
Certification no less than 45 days prior to their date of need. The employer will simultaneously submit Form ETA790 Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order, along with the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, directly to the NPC having jurisdiction over H-2A applications.

(ii) Pre-filing activities. Activities required to be conducted prior to filing under the final rule will be
conducted post-filing during this transition period. The employer will be expected to make attestations in its
application applicable to its future activities concerning recruitment, payment of the offered wage rate, etc.
Employers will not be required to complete an initial recruitment report for submission with the application, but will
be required to complete a recruitment report for submission to the NPC prior to certification, and will also be
required to complete a final recruitment report covering the entire recruitment period.
(iii) Acceptance of application. Upon receipt, the NPC will provide the employer with the wage rate to be
offered, at a minimum, by the employer, and will process the application in a manner consistent with new §655.107,
issuing a notification of deficiencies for any curable deficiencies within 7 calendar days.
(iv) Processing of application. Once the application and job order have been accepted, the NPC will transmit a
copy of the job order to the SWA(s) serving the area of intended employment to initiate intrastate and interstate
clearance, request that the SWA(s) schedule an inspection of the housing, and provide instructions to the employer
to commence positive recruitment in a manner consistent with §655.102(d)(2) through (4). The NPC will designate
labor supply States during this period on a case-by-case basis. Such designations must be based on information
provided by State agencies or by other sources, and will to the extent information is available take into account the
success of recent efforts by out-of-State employers to recruit in that State.
(c) Definitions of terms used in this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart:
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) means a person within the DOL's Office of Administrative Law Judges
appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105, or a panel of such persons designated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge
from the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) established by part 656 of this chapter, which will
hear and decide appeals as set forth in §655.115.
Administrator, OFLC means the primary official of the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), or the

employed U.S. workers will not be adversely affected.
Agent means a legal entity or person, such as an association of agricultural employers, or an attorney for an
association, that:
(1) Is authorized to act on behalf of the employer for temporary agricultural labor certification purposes;
(2) Is not itself an employer, or a joint employer, as defined in this paragraph (c) of this section with respect to
a specific application; and

Department, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the immigration judges, or the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) under 8 CFR 292.3 or 1003.101.
Agricultural association means any nonprofit or cooperative association of farmers, growers, or ranchers
(including but not limited to processing establishments, canneries, gins, packing sheds, nurseries, or other fixed-site
agricultural employers), incorporated or qualified under applicable State law, that recruits, solicits, hires, employs,
furnishes, houses or transports any worker that is subject to sec. 218 of the INA. An agricultural association may act

also act as the sole or joint employer of H-2A workers.

Application for Temporary Employment Certification means the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)approved form submitted by an employer to secure a temporary agricultural labor certification determination from
DOL. A complete submission of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification includes both the form
and the employer's initial recruitment report.
Area of intended employment means the geographic area within normal commuting distance of the place
(worksite address) of the job opportunity for which the certification is sought. There is no rigid measure of distance
which constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying
factual circumstances among different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the worksite,
quality of the regional transportation network, etc.). If the place of intended employment is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA), including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to be within normal
commuting distance of the place of intended employment. The borders of MSAs are not controlling in the
identification of the normal commuting area; a location outside of an MSA may be within normal commuting
distance of a location that is inside (e.g., near the border of) the MSA.
Attorney means any person who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State,
possession, territory, or commonwealth of the U.S., or the District of Columbia, and who is not under suspension,

determination under the INA on whether to grant visa petitions filed by employers seeking H-2A workers to perform
temporary agricultural work in the U.S.
DOL or Department means the United States Department of Labor.
Eligible worker means an individual who is not an unauthorized alien (as defined in sec. 274A(h)(3) of the
INA, 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)) with respect to the employment in which the worker is engaging.
Employee means employee as defined under the general common law of agency. Some of the factors relevant
to the determination of employee status include: the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which
the work is accomplished; the skill required to perform the work; the source of the instrumentalities and tools for
accomplishing the work; the location of the work; the hiring party's discretion over when and how long to work; and
whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party. Other applicable factors may be considered and
no one factor is dispositive.

associated with the firm in the violations resulting in a debarment recommendation. Normally, wholly new
management or ownership of the same business operation, one in which the former management or owner does not
retain a direct or indirect interest, will not be deemed to be a successor in interest for purposes of debarment. A

wages and working conditions of workers in the U.S. similarly employed (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 1184(a)
and (c), and 1188).

regulations, including those terms and conditions attested to by the H-2A employer, which contract between the
employer and the worker may be in the form of a separate written document. In the absence of a separate written
work contract incorporating the required terms and conditions of employment, agreed to by both the employer and
the worker, the work contract at a minimum shall be the terms of the job order, as provided in 20 CFR part 653,
Subpart F, and covered provisions of the work contract shall be enforced in accordance with these regulations.
(d) Definition of agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. For the purposes of this

one-half of the commodity with respect to which such service is performed;
(2) In the employ of a group of operators of farms (other than a cooperative organization) in the performance
of service described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D)(1) of this section, but only if such operators produced all of the
commodity with respect to which such service is performed. For purposes of this paragraph, any unincorporated
group of operators will be deemed a cooperative organization if the number of operators comprising such group is
more than 20 at any time during the calendar quarter in which such service is performed;
(3) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(D)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to services performed in
connection with commercial canning or commercial freezing or in connection with any agricultural or horticultural

(3) Of a temporary or seasonal nature—(i) On a seasonal or other temporary basis. For the purposes of this
subpart, of a temporary or seasonal nature means on a seasonal or other temporary basis, as defined in the WHD's
regulation at 29 CFR 500.20 under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA).
(ii) MSPA definition. The definition of on a seasonal or other temporary basis found in MSPA is summarized

(A) Labor is performed on a seasonal basis where, ordinarily, the employment pertains to or is of the kind
exclusively performed at certain seasons or periods of the year and which, from its nature, may not be continuous or
carried on throughout the year. A worker who moves from one seasonal activity to another, while employed in
agriculture or performing agricultural labor, is employed on a seasonal basis even though the worker may continue
to be employed during a major portion of the year.
(B) A worker is employed on other temporary basis where he or she is employed for a limited time only or the
worker's performance is contemplated for a particular piece of work, usually of short duration. Generally,
employment which is contemplated to continue indefinitely is not temporary.
(C) On a seasonal or other temporary basis does not include (i) the employment of any foreman or other
supervisory employee who is employed by a specific agricultural employer or agricultural association essentially on
a year round basis; or (ii) the employment of any worker who is living at his or her permanent place of residence,
when that worker is employed by a specific agricultural employer or agricultural association on essentially a year
round basis to perform a variety of tasks for his or her employer and is not primarily employed to do field work.
(iii) Temporary. For the purposes of this subpart, the definition of “temporary” in paragraph (d)(3) of this
section refers to any job opportunity covered by this subpart where the employer needs a worker for a position for a
limited period of time, including, but not limited to, a peakload need, which is generally less than 1 year, unless the
original temporary agricultural labor certification is extended pursuant to §655.110.

§655.1301 Applications for temporary employment certification in agriculture.
(a) Application filing requirements. (1) An employer that desires to apply for temporary employment
certification of one or more nonimmigrant foreign workers must file a completed DOL Application for Temporary
Employment Certification form and, unless a specific exemption applies, the initial recruitment report. If an
association of agricultural producers files the application, the association must identify whether it is the sole
employer, a joint employer with its employer-member employers, or the agent of its employer-members. The
association must retain documentation substantiating the employer or agency status of the association and be
prepared to submit such documentation to the CO in the event of an audit.
(2) If an H-2ALC intends to file an application, the H-2ALC must meet all of the requirements of the
definition of employer in §655.100(b), and comply with all the assurances, guarantees, and other requirements
contained in this part and in part 653, subpart F, of this chapter. The H-2ALC must have a place of business
(physical location) in the U.S. and a means by which it may be contacted for employment. H-2A workers employed
by an H-2ALC may not perform services for a fixed-site employer unless the H-2ALC is itself providing the
housing and transportation required by §655.104(d) and (h), or has filed a statement confirming that the fixed-site
employer will provide compliant housing and/or transportation, as required by §655.106, with the OFLC, for each
fixed-site employer listed on the application. The H-2ALC must retain a copy of the statement of compliance
required by §655.106(b)(6).
(3) An association of agricultural producers may submit a master application covering a variety of job
opportunities available with a number of employers in multiple areas of intended employment, just as though all of
the covered employers were in fact a single employer, as long as a single date of need is provided for all workers
requested by the application and the combination of job opportunities is supported by an explanation demonstrating

a business reason for the combination. The association must identify on the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, by name and address, each employer that will employ H-2A workers. If the association is acting solely
as an agent, each employer will receive a separate labor certification.
(b) Filing. The employer may send the Application for Temporary Employment Certification and all
supporting documentation by U.S. Mail or private mail courier to the NPC. The Department will publish a Notice in
the FEDERAL REGISTER identifying the address(es), and any future address changes, to which applications must be
mailed, and will also post these addresses on the DOL Internet Web site at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/.
The form must bear the original signature of the employer (and that of the employer's authorized attorney or agent if
the employer is represented by an attorney or agent). An association filing a master application as a joint employer
may sign on behalf of its employer members. The Department may also require applications to be filed
electronically in addition to or instead of by mail.
(c) Timeliness. A completed Application for Temporary Employment Certification must be filed no less than
45 calendar days before date of need.
(d) Emergency situations—(1) Waiver of time period and required pre-filing activity. The CO may waive the
time period for filing and pre-filing wage and recruitment requirements set forth in §655.102, along with their
associated attestations, for employers who did not make use of temporary alien agricultural workers during the prior
year's agricultural season or for any employer that has other good and substantial cause (which may include
unforeseen changes in market conditions), provided that the CO can timely make the determinations required by
§655.109(b).
(2) Employer requirements. The employer requesting a waiver of the required time period and pre-filing wage
and recruitment requirements must submit to the NPC a completed Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, a completed job offer on the ETA Form 790 Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order, and
a statement justifying the request for a waiver of the time period requirement. The statement must indicate whether
the waiver request is due to the fact that the employer did not use H-2A workers during the prior agricultural season
or whether the request is for other good and substantial cause. If the waiver is requested for good and substantial
cause, the employer's statement must also include detailed information describing the good and substantial cause
which has necessitated the waiver request. Good and substantial cause may include, but is not limited to, such things
as the substantial loss of U.S. workers due to weather-related activities or other reasons, unforeseen events affecting
the work activities to be performed, pandemic health issues, or similar conditions.
(3) Processing of applications. The CO shall promptly transmit the job order, on behalf of the employer, to the
SWA serving the area of intended employment and request an expedited review of the job order in accordance with
§655.102(e) and an inspection of housing in accordance with §655.104(d)(6)(iii). The CO shall process the
application and job order in accordance with §655.107, issue a wage determination in accordance with §655.108
and, upon acceptance, require the employer to engage in positive recruitment consistent with §655.102(d)(2), (3),
and (4). The CO shall require the SWA to transmit the job order for interstate clearance consistent with §655.102(f).
The CO shall specify a date on which the employer will be required to submit a recruitment report in accordance
with §655.102(k). The CO will make a determination on the application in accordance with §655.109.
§655.1302 Required pre-filing activity.
(a) Time of filing of application. An employer may not file an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification before all of the pre-filing recruitment steps set forth in this section have been fully satisfied, except
where specifically exempted from some or all of those requirements by these regulations. Modifications to these
requirements for H-2ALCs are set forth in §655.106.
(b) General attestation obligation. An employer must attest on the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification that it will comply with all of the assurances and obligations of this subpart and to performing all
necessary steps of the recruitment process as specified in this section.

(c) Retention of documentation. An employer filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification
must maintain documentation of its advertising and recruitment efforts as required in this subpart and be prepared to
submit this documentation in response to a Notice of Deficiency from the CO prior to the CO rendering a Final
Determination, or in the event of an audit. The documentation required in this subpart must be retained for a period
of no less than 3 years from the date of the certification. There is no record retention requirement for any application
(and supporting documentation) after the Secretary has made a final decision to deny the application.
(d) Positive recruitment steps. An employer filing an application must:
(1) Submit a job order to the SWA serving the area of intended employment;
(2) Run two print advertisements (one of which must be on a Sunday, except as provided in paragraph (g) of
this section);
(3) Contact former U.S. employees who were employed within the last year as described in paragraph (h) of
this section; and
(4) Based on an annual determination made by the Secretary, as described in paragraph (i) of this section,
recruit in all States currently designated as a State of traditional or expected labor supply with respect to each area of
intended employment in which the employer's work is to be performed as required in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
(e) Job order. (1) The employer must submit a job order to the SWA serving the area of intended employment
no more than 75 calendar days and no fewer than 60 calendar days before the date of need for intrastate and
interstate clearance, identifying it as a job order to be placed in connection with a future application for H-2A
workers. If the job opportunity is located in more than one State, the employer may submit a job order to any one of
the SWAs having jurisdiction over the anticipated worksites. Where a future master application will be filed by an
association of agricultural employers, the SWA will prepare a single job order in the name of the association on
behalf of all employers that will be duly named on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
Documentation of this step by the applicant is satisfied by maintaining proof of posting from the SWA identifying
the job order number(s) with the start and end dates of the posting of the job order.
(2) The job order submitted to the SWA must satisfy all the requirements for newspaper advertisements
contained in §655.103 and comply with the requirements for agricultural clearance orders in 20 CFR part 653
Subpart F and the requirements set forth in §655.104.
(3) The SWA will review the contents of the job order as provided in 20 CFR part 653 Subpart F and will
work with the employer to address any deficiencies, except that the order may be placed prior to completion of the
housing inspection required by 20 CFR 653.501(d)(6) where necessary to meet the timeframes required by statute
and regulation. However, the SWA must ensure that housing within its jurisdiction is inspected as expeditiously as
possible thereafter. Any issue with regard to whether a job order may properly be placed in the job service system
that cannot be resolved with the applicable SWA may be brought to the attention of the NPC, which may direct that
the job order be placed in the system where the NPC determines that the applicable program requirements have been
met. If the NPC concludes that the job order is not acceptable, it shall so inform the employer using the procedures
applicable to a denial of certification set forth in §655.109(e).
(f) Intrastate/Interstate recruitment. (1) Upon receipt and acceptance of the job order, the SWA must promptly
place the job order in intrastate clearance on its active file and begin recruitment of eligible U.S. workers. The SWA
receiving the job order under paragraph (e) of this section will promptly transmit, on behalf of the employer, a copy
of its active job order to all States listed in the job order as anticipated worksites. The SWA must also transmit a
copy of all active job orders to no fewer than three States, which must include those States, if any, designated by the
Secretary as traditional or expected labor supply States (“out-of-State recruitment States”) for the area of intended
employment in which the employer's work is to be performed as defined in paragraph (i) of this section.

(2) Unless otherwise directed by the CO, the SWA must keep the job order open for interstate clearance until
the end of the recruitment period, as set forth in §655.102(f)(3). Each of the SWAs to which the job order was
referred must keep the job order open for that same period of time and must refer each eligible U.S. worker who
applies (or on whose behalf an application is made) for the job opportunity.
(3)(i) For the first 5 years after the effective date of this rule, the recruitment period shall end 30 days after the
first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A workers, or on the last day the employer requires the
services of H-2A workers in the applicable area of intended employment, whichever is sooner (the 30-day rule).
During that 5-year period, the Department will endeavor to study the costs and benefits of providing for continuing
recruitment of U.S. workers after the H-2A workers have already entered the country. Unless prior to the expiration
of the 5-year period the Department conducts a study and publishes a notice determining that the economic benefits
of such extended recruitment period outweigh its costs, the recruitment period will, after the expiration of the 5-year
period, end on the first date the employer requires the services of the H-2A worker.
(ii) Withholding of U.S. workers prohibited. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply so as long as the 30day rule is in place.
(A) Complaints. Any employer who has reason to believe that a person or entity has willfully and knowingly
withheld U.S. workers prior to the arrival at the job site of H-2A workers in order to force the hiring of U.S. workers
during the 30-day rule under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section may submit a written complaint to the CO. The
complaint must clearly identify the person or entity who the employer believes has withheld the U.S. workers, and
must specify sufficient facts to support the allegation (e.g., dates, places, numbers and names of U.S. workers)
which will permit an investigation to be conducted by the CO.
(B) Investigations. The CO must immediately investigate the complaint. The investigation must include
interviews with the employer who has submitted the complaint, the person or entity named as responsible for
withholding the U.S. workers, and the individual U.S. workers whose availability has purportedly been withheld.
(C) Written findings. Where the CO determines, after conducting the interviews required by this paragraph,
that the employer's complaint is valid and justified, the CO shall immediately suspend the application of the 30-day
rule under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section to the employer. The CO's determination shall be the final decision of
the Secretary.
(g) Newspaper advertisements. (1) During the period of time that the job order is being circulated by the
SWA(s) for interstate clearance under paragraph (f) of this section, the employer must place an advertisement on 2
separate days, which may be consecutive, one of which must be a Sunday (except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of
this section), in a newspaper of general circulation serving the area of intended employment that has a reasonable
distribution and is appropriate to the occupation and the workers likely to apply for the job opportunity. Both
newspaper advertisements must be published only after the job order is accepted by the SWA for intrastate/interstate
clearance.
(2) If the job opportunity is located in a rural area that does not have a newspaper with a Sunday edition, the
employer must, in place of a Sunday edition, advertise in the regularly published daily edition with the widest
circulation in the area of intended employment.
(3) The newspaper advertisements must satisfy the requirements of §§655.103 and 655.104. The employer
must maintain copies of newspaper pages (with date of publication and full copy of ad), or tear sheets of the pages
of the publication in which the advertisements appeared, or other proof of publication containing the text of the
printed advertisements and the dates of publication furnished by the newspaper.
(4) If a professional, trade or ethnic publication is more appropriate for the occupation and the workers likely
to apply for the job opportunity than a general circulation newspaper, and is the most likely source to bring
responses from able, willing, qualified, and available U.S. workers, the employer may use a professional, trade or

ethnic publication in place of one of the newspaper advertisements, but may not replace the Sunday advertisement
(or the substitute required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section).
(h) Contact with former U.S. employees. The employer must contact by mail or other effective means its
former U.S. employees (except those who were dismissed for cause, abandoned the worksite, or were provided
documentation at the end of their previous period of employment explaining the lawful, job-related reasons they
would not be re-contacted) employed by the employer in the occupation at the place of employment during the
previous year and solicit their return to the job. The employer must maintain copies of correspondence signed and
dated by the employer or, if other means are used, maintain dated logs demonstrating that each worker was
contacted, including the phone number, e-mail address, or other means that was used to make contact. The employer
must list in the recruitment report any workers who did not return to the employ of the employer because they were
either unable or unwilling to return to the job or did not respond to the employer's request, and must retain
documentation, if provided by the worker, showing evidence of their inability, unwillingness, or nonresponsiveness.
(i) Additional positive recruitment. (1) Each year, the Secretary will make a determination with respect to each
State whether there are other States (“traditional or expected labor supply States”) in which there are a significant
number of able and qualified workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work in
that State, as well as which newspapers in each traditional or expected labor supply State that the employer may use
to fulfill its obligation to run a newspaper advertisement in that State. Such determination must be based on
information provided by State agencies or by other sources within the 120 days preceding the determination (which
will be solicited by notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER), and will to the extent information is available take into
account the success of recent efforts by out-of-State employers to recruit in that State. The Secretary will not
designate a State as a traditional or expected labor supply State if the State has a significant number of employers
that are recruiting for U.S. workers for the same types of occupations and comparable work. The Secretary's annual
determination as to traditional or expected labor supply States, if any, from which applicants from each State must
recruit will be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and made available through the ETA Web site.
(2) Each employer must engage in positive recruitment in those States designated in accordance with
paragraph (i)(1) with respect to the State in which the employer's work is to be performed. Such recruitment will
consist of one newspaper advertisement in each State in one of the newspapers designated by the Secretary,
published within the same period of time as the newspaper advertisements required under paragraph (g) of this
section. An employer will not be required to conduct positive recruitment in more than three States designated in
accordance with paragraph (i)(1) for each area of intended employment listed on the employer's application. The
advertisement must refer applicants to the SWA nearest the area in which the advertisement was placed.
(j) Referrals of U.S. workers. SWAs may only refer for employment individuals for whom they have verified
identity and employment authorization through the process for employment verification of all workers that is
established by INA sec. 274A(b). SWAs must provide documentation certifying the employment verification that
satisfies the standards of INA sec. 274A(a)(5) and its implementing regulations at 8 CFR 274a.6.
(k) Recruitment report. (1) No more than 50 days before the date of need the employer must prepare, sign, and
date a written recruitment report. The recruitment report must be submitted with the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. The recruitment report must:
(i) List the original number of openings for which the employer recruited;
(ii) Identify each recruitment source by name;
(iii) State the name and contact information of each U.S. worker who applied or was referred to the job
opportunity up to the date of the preparation of the recruitment report, and the disposition of each worker;
(iv) Confirm that former employees were contacted and by what means; and

(v) If applicable, explain the lawful job-related reason(s) for not hiring any U.S. workers who applied for the
position.
(2) The employer must update the recruitment report within 48 hours of the date that is the end of the
recruitment period as specified in §655.102(f)(3). This supplement to the recruitment report must meet the
requirements of paragraph (k)(1) of this section. The employer must sign and date this supplement to the recruitment
report and retain it for a period of no less than 3 years. The supplement to the recruitment report must be provided in
the event of an audit.
(3) The employer must retain resumes (if provided) of, and evidence of contact with (which may be in the
form of an attestation), each U.S. worker who applied or was referred to the job opportunity. Such resumes and
evidence of contact must be retained along with the recruitment report and the supplemental recruitment report for a
period of no less than 3 years, and must be provided in response to a Notice of Deficiency or in the event of an audit.
§655.1303 Advertising requirements.
All advertising conducted to satisfy the required recruitment steps under §655.102 before filing the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification must meet the requirements set forth in this section and at
§655.104 and must contain terms and conditions of employment which are not less favorable than those that will be
offered to the H-2A workers. All advertising must contain the following information:
(a) The employer's name and location(s) of work, or in the event that a master application will be filed by an
association, a statement indicating that the name and location of each member of the association can be obtained
from the SWA of the State in which the advertisement is run;
(b) The geographic area(s) of employment with enough specificity to apprise applicants of any travel
requirements and where applicants will likely have to reside to perform the services or labor;
(c) A description of the job opportunity for which certification is sought with sufficient information to apprise
U.S. workers of services or labor to be performed and the anticipated period of employment of the job opportunity;
(d) The wage offer, or in the event that there are multiple wage offers (such as where a master application will
be filed by an association and/or where there are multiple crop activities for a single employer), the range of
applicable wage offers and, where a master application will be filed by an association, a statement indicating that the
rate(s) applicable to each employer can be obtained from the SWA;
(e) The three-fourths guarantee specified in §655.104(i);
(f) If applicable, a statement that work tools, supplies, and equipment will be provided at no cost to the
worker;
(g) A statement that housing will be made available at no cost to workers, including U.S. workers, who cannot
reasonably return to their permanent residence at the end of each working day;
(h) If applicable, a statement that transportation and subsistence expenses to the worksite will be provided by
the employer;
(i) A statement that the position is temporary and a specification of the total number of job openings the
employer intends to fill;
(j) A statement directing applicants to report or send resumes to the SWA of the State in which the
advertisement is run for referral to the employer;

(k) Contact information for the applicable SWA and the job order number.
§655.1304 Contents of job offers.
(a) Preferential treatment of aliens prohibited. The employer's job offer must offer to U.S. workers no less
than the same benefits, wages, and working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide
to H-2A workers. Except where otherwise permitted under this section, no job offer may impose on U.S. workers
any restrictions or obligations that will not be imposed on the employer's H-2A workers.
(b) Job qualifications. Each job qualification listed in the job offer must not substantially deviate from the
normal and accepted qualifications required by employers that do not use H-2A workers in the same or comparable
occupations and crops.
(c) Minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. Every job offer accompanying an H-2A application
must include each of the minimum benefit, wage, and working condition provisions listed in paragraphs (d) through
(q) of this section.
(d) Housing—(1) Obligation to provide housing. The employer must provide housing at no cost to the worker,
except for those U.S. workers who are reasonably able to return to their permanent residence at the end of the work
day. Housing must be provided through one of the following means:
(i) Employer-provided housing. Employer-provided housing that meets the full set of DOL OSHA standards
set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142, or the full set of standards at §§654.404 through 654.417 of this chapter, whichever
are applicable under §654.401; or
(ii) Rental and/or public accommodations. Rental or public accommodations or other substantially similar
class of habitation that meets applicable local standards for such housing. In the absence of applicable local
standards, State standards will apply. In the absence of applicable local or State standards, DOL OSHA standards at
29 CFR 1910.142 will apply. Any charges for rental housing must be paid directly by the employer to the owner or
operator of the housing. The employer must document that the housing complies with the local, State, or Federal
housing standards. Such documentation may include but is not limited to a certificate from a State Department of
Health or other State or local agency or a statement from the manager or owner of the housing.
(2) Standards for range housing. Housing for workers principally engaged in the range production of livestock
shall meet standards of DOL OSHA for such housing. In the absence of such standards, range housing for
sheepherders and other workers engaged in the range production of livestock must meet guidelines issued by ETA.
(3) Deposit charges. Charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other similar incidentals related to housing
must not be levied upon workers. However, employers may require workers to reimburse them for damage caused to
housing, bedding, or other property by the individual workers found to have been responsible for damage which is
not the result of normal wear and tear related to habitation.
(4) Charges for public housing. If public housing provided for migrant agricultural workers under the auspices
of a local, county, or State government is secured by the employer, the employer must pay any charges normally
required for use of the public housing units (but need not pay for optional, extra services) directly to the housing's
management.
(5) Family housing. When it is the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment and the occupation
to provide family housing, family housing must be provided to workers with families who request it.
(6) Housing inspection. In order to ensure that the housing provided by an employer under this section meets
the relevant standard:

(i) An employer must make the required attestation, which may include an attestation that the employer is
complying with the procedures set forth in §654.403, at the time of filing the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification pursuant to §655.105(e)(2).
(ii) The employer must make a request to the SWA for a housing inspection no less than 60 days before the
date of need, except where otherwise provided under this part.
(iii) The SWA must make its determination that the housing meets the statutory criteria applicable to the type
of housing provided prior to the date on which the Secretary is required to make a certification determination under
INA sec. 218(c)(3)(A), which is 30 days before the employer's date of need. SWAs must not adopt rules or
restrictions on housing inspections that unreasonably prevent inspections from being completed in the required time
frame, such as rules that no inspections will be conducted where the housing is already occupied or is not yet leased.
If the employer has attested to and met all other criteria for certification, and the employer has made a timely request
for a housing inspection under this paragraph, and the SWA has failed to complete a housing inspection by the
statutory deadline of 30 days prior to date of need, the certification will not be withheld on account of the SWA's
failure to meet the statutory deadline. The SWA must in such cases inspect the housing prior to or during occupation
to ensure it meets applicable housing standards. If, upon inspection, the SWA determines the supplied housing does
not meet the applicable housing standards, the SWA must promptly provide written notification to the employer and
the CO. The CO will take appropriate action, including notice to the employer to cure deficiencies. An employer's
failure to cure substantial violations can result in revocation of the temporary labor certification.
(7) Certified housing that becomes unavailable. If after a request to certify housing (but before certification),
or after certification of housing, such housing becomes unavailable for reasons outside the employer's control, the
employer may substitute other rental or public accommodation housing that is in compliance with the local, State, or
Federal housing standards applicable under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and for which the employer is able to
submit evidence of such compliance. The employer must notify the SWA in writing of the change in
accommodations and the reason(s) for such change and provide the SWA evidence of compliance with the
applicable local, State or Federal safety and health standards, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph
(d)(1)(ii) of this section. The SWA must notify the CO of all housing changes and of any noncompliance with the
standards set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Substantial noncompliance can result in revocation of the
temporary labor certification under §655.117.
(e) Workers' compensation. The employer must provide workers' compensation insurance coverage in
compliance with State law covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment.
If the type of employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by or is exempt from the State's
workers' compensation law, the employer must provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and
disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment that will provide benefits at least equal to those
provided under the State workers' compensation law for other comparable employment. The employer must retain
for 3 years from the date of certification of the application, the name of the insurance carrier, the insurance policy
number, and proof of insurance for the dates of need, or, if appropriate, proof of State law coverage.
(f) Employer-provided items. Except as provided in this paragraph, the employer must provide to the worker,
without charge or deposit charge, all tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned. The
employer may charge the worker for reasonable costs related to the worker's refusal or negligent failure to return any
property furnished by the employer or due to such worker's willful damage or destruction of such property. Where it
is a common practice in the particular area, crop activity and occupation for workers to provide tools and equipment,
with or without the employer reimbursing the workers for the cost of providing them, such an arrangement will be
permitted, provided that the requirements of sec. 3(m) of the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. 203(m) are met. Section 3(m) does
not permit deductions for tools or equipment primarily for the benefit of the employer that reduce an employee's
wage below the wage required under the minimum wage, or, where applicable, the overtime provisions of the FLSA.
(g) Meals. The employer either must provide each worker with three meals a day or must furnish free and
convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to the workers that will enable the workers to prepare their own meals.
Where the employer provides the meals, the job offer must state the charge, if any, to the worker for such meals. The
amount of meal charges is governed by §655.114.

(h) Transportation; daily subsistence—(1) Transportation to place of employment. If the employer has not
previously advanced such transportation and subsistence costs to the worker or otherwise provided such
transportation or subsistence directly to the worker by other means and if the worker completes 50 percent of the
work contract period, the employer must pay the worker for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for
transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker has departed to the employer's place of
employment. For an H-2A worker coming from outside of the U.S., the place from which the worker has departed is
the place of recruitment, which the Department interprets to mean the appropriate U.S. consulate or port of entry.
When it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2A agricultural employers in the occupation in the area to do so, or when
the employer extends such benefits to similarly situated H-2A workers, the employer must advance the required
transportation and subsistence costs (or otherwise provide them) to U.S. workers. The amount of the transportation
payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier
transportation charges for the distances involved. The amount of the daily subsistence payment must be at least as
much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a day during employment
(if applicable), but in no event less than the amount permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) Transportation from last place of employment to home country. If the worker completes the work contract
period, and the worker has no immediately subsequent H-2A employment, the employer must provide or pay for the
worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker,
disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer. For an H-2A worker coming from outside
of the U.S., the place from which the worker has departed will be considered to be the appropriate U.S. consulate or
port of entry.
(3) Transportation between living quarters and worksite. The employer must provide transportation between
the worker's living quarters (i.e., housing provided or secured by the employer pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
section) and the employer's worksite at no cost to the worker, and such transportation must comply with all
applicable Federal, State or local laws and regulations, and must provide, at a minimum, the same vehicle safety
standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as required under 29 U.S.C. 1841 and 29 CFR part 500, subpart D.
If workers' compensation is used to cover such transportation, in lieu of vehicle insurance, the employer must either
ensure that the workers' compensation covers all travel or that vehicle insurance exists to provide coverage for travel
not covered by workers' compensation.
(i) Three-fourths guarantee—(1) Offer to worker. The employer must guarantee to offer the worker
employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least three-fourths of the workdays of the total period
beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or the advertised
contractual first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the work contract or
in its extensions, if any. For purposes of this paragraph a workday means the number of hours in a workday as stated
in the job order and excludes the worker's Sabbath and Federal holidays. The employer must offer a total number of
hours to ensure the provision of sufficient work to reach the three-fourths guarantee. The work hours must be
offered during the work period specified in the work contract, or during any modified work contract period to which
the worker and employer have mutually agreed and has been approved by the CO. The work contract period can be
shortened by agreement of the parties only with the approval of the CO. In the event the worker begins working later
than the specified beginning date of the contract, the guarantee period begins with the first workday after the arrival
of the worker at the place of employment, and continues until the last day during which the work contract and all
extensions thereof are in effect. Therefore, if, for example, a work contract is for a 10-week period, during which a
normal workweek is specified as 6 days a week, 8 hours per day, the worker would have to be guaranteed
employment for at least 360 hours (e.g., 10 weeks × 48 hours/week = 480-hours × 75 percent = 360). If a Federal
holiday occurred during the 10-week span, the 8 hours would be deducted from the total guaranteed. A worker may
be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday. For purposes of meeting the guarantee,
however, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a
workday, or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays. However, all hours of work actually performed may be
counted by the employer in calculating whether the period of guaranteed employment has been met. If the employer
affords the U.S. or H-2A worker during the total work contract period less employment than that required under this
paragraph, the employer must pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the worker, in fact,
worked for the guaranteed number of days.

(2) Guarantee for piece rate paid worker. If the worker will be paid on a piece rate basis, the employer must
use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the AEWR, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due
under the guarantee.
(3) Failure to work. Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in
the job order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to do so in accordance with paragraph
(i)(1) of this section, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary work over 8 hours in a workday
or on the worker's Sabbath or Federal holidays), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether the period
of guaranteed employment has been met. An employer seeking to calculate whether the number of hours has been
met must maintain the payroll records in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
(4) Displaced H-2A worker. The employer is not liable for payment under paragraph (i)(1) of this section to an
H-2A worker whom the CO certifies is displaced because of the employer's compliance with §655.105(d) with
respect to referrals made after the employer's date of need. The employer is, however, liable for return transportation
for any such displaced worker in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(5) Obligation to provide housing and meals. Notwithstanding the three-fourths guarantee contained in this
section, employers are obligated to provide housing and subsistence for each day of the contract period up until the
day the workers depart for other H-2A employment, depart to the place outside of the U.S. from which the worker
came, or, if the worker voluntarily abandons employment or is terminated for cause, the day of such abandonment or
termination.
(j) Earnings records. (1) The employer must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers'
earnings, including but not limited to field tally records, supporting summary payroll records, and records showing
the nature and amount of the work performed; the number of hours of work offered each day by the employer
(broken out by hours offered both in accordance with and over and above the three-fourths guarantee at paragraph
(i)(3) of this section); the hours actually worked each day by the worker; the time the worker began and ended each
workday; the rate of pay (both piece rate and hourly, if applicable); the worker's earnings per pay period; the
worker's home address; and the amount of and reasons for any and all deductions taken from the worker's wages.
(2) Each employer must keep the records required by this part, including field tally records and supporting
summary payroll records, safe and accessible at the place or places of employment, or at one or more established
central recordkeeping offices where such records are customarily maintained. All records must be available for
inspection and transcription by the Secretary or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker
and representatives designated by the worker as evidenced by appropriate documentation (an Entry of Appearance
as Attorney or Representative, Form G-28, signed by the worker, or an affidavit signed by the worker confirming
such representation). Where the records are maintained at a central recordkeeping office, other than in the place or
places of employment, such records must be made available for inspection and copying within 72 hours following
notice from the Secretary, or a duly authorized and designated representative, and by the worker and designated
representatives as described in this paragraph.
(3) To assist in determining whether the three-fourths guarantee in paragraph (i) of this section has been met,
if the number of hours worked by the worker on a day during the work contract period is less than the number of
hours offered, as specified in the job offer, the records must state the reason or reasons therefore.
(4) The employer must retain the records for not less than 3 years after the completion of the work contract.
(k) Hours and earnings statements. The employer must furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one
or more written statements the following information:
(1) The worker's total earnings for the pay period;
(2) The worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;

(3) The hours of employment offered to the worker (broken out by offers in accordance with, and over and
above, the guarantee);
(4) The hours actually worked by the worker;
(5) An itemization of all deductions made from the worker's wages; and
(6) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily.
(l) Rates of pay. (1) If the worker is paid by the hour, the employer must pay the worker at least the AEWR in
effect at the time recruitment for the position was begun, the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate,
or the Federal or State minimum wage rate, whichever is highest, for every hour or portion thereof worked during a
pay period; or
(2)(i) If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and the piece rate does not result at the end of the pay period in
average hourly piece rate earnings during the pay period at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned
had the worker been paid at the appropriate hourly rate, the worker's pay must be supplemented at that time so that
the worker's earnings are at least as much as the worker would have earned during the pay period if the worker had
instead been paid at the appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour worked;
(ii) The piece rate must be no less than the piece rate prevailing for the activity in the area of intended
employment; and
(iii) If the employer who pays by the piece rate requires one or more minimum productivity standards of
workers as a condition of job retention, such standards must be specified in the job offer and must be normal,
meaning that they may not be unusual for workers performing the same activity in the area of intended employment.
(m) Frequency of pay. The employer must state in the job offer the frequency with which the worker will be
paid, which must be at least twice monthly.
(n) Abandonment of employment or termination for cause. If the worker voluntarily abandons employment
before the end of the contract period, fails to report for employment at the beginning of the contract period, or is
terminated for cause, and the employer notifies the Department and DHS in writing or by any other method
specified by the Department or DHS in a manner specified in a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER not later
than 2 working days after such abandonment or abscondment occurs, the employer will not be responsible for
providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and subsistence expenses of that worker under paragraph (h)
of this section, and that worker is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee described in paragraph (i) of this section.
An abandonment or abscondment shall be deemed to begin after a worker fails to report for work at the regularly
scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of the employer. Employees may be terminated
for cause, however, for shorter unexcused periods of time that shall not be considered abandonment or abscondment.
(o) Contract impossibility. If, before the expiration date specified in the work contract, the services of the
worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of
God that makes the fulfillment of the contract impossible, the employer may terminate the work contract. Whether
such an event constitutes a contract impossibility will be determined by the CO. In the event of such termination of a
contract, the employer must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee for the time that has elapsed from the start of the work
contract to the time of its termination as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The employer must:
(1) Return the worker, at the employer's expense, to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening
employment) came to work for the employer, or transport the worker to the worker's next certified H-2A employer
(but only if the worker can provide documentation supporting such employment), whichever the worker prefers. For
an H-2A worker coming from outside of the U.S., the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening
employment) came to work for the employer is the appropriate U.S. consulate or port of entry;

(2) Reimburse the worker the full amount of any deductions made from the worker's pay by the employer for
transportation and subsistence expenses to the place of employment; and
(3) Pay the worker for any costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence to that
employer's place of employment. Daily subsistence will be computed as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section.
The amount of the transportation payment will be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical
and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved.
(p) Deductions. The employer must make all deductions from the worker's paycheck that are required by law.
The job offer must specify all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from the worker's
paycheck. All deductions must be reasonable. However, an employer subject to the FLSA may not make deductions
that would violate the FLSA.
(q) Copy of work contract. The employer must provide to the worker, no later than on the day the work
commences, a copy of the work contract between the employer and the worker. The work contract must contain all
of the provisions required by paragraphs (a) through (p) of this section. In the absence of a separate, written work
contract entered into between the employer and the worker, the job order, as provided in 20 CFR part 653, Subpart
F, will be the work contract.
§655.1305 Assurances and obligations of H-2A employers.
An employer seeking to employ H-2A workers must attest as part of the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification that it will abide by the following conditions of this subpart:
(a) The job opportunity is and will continue through the recruitment period to be open to any qualified U.S.
worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, handicap, or citizenship, and the employer has
conducted and will continue to conduct the required recruitment, in accordance with regulations, and has been
unsuccessful in locating sufficient numbers of qualified U.S. applicants for the job opportunity for which
certification is sought. Any U.S. workers who applied or apply for the job were or will be rejected only for lawful,
job-related reasons, and those not rejected on this basis have been or will be hired. In addition, the employer attests
that it will retain records of all rejections as required by §655.119.
(b) The employer is offering terms and working conditions which are not less favorable than those offered to
the H-2A worker(s) and are not less than the minimum terms and conditions required by this subpart.
(c) The specific job opportunity for which the employer is requesting H-2A certification is not vacant because
the former occupant is on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor dispute.
(d) The employer will continue to cooperate with the SWA by accepting referrals of all eligible U.S. workers
who apply (or on whose behalf an application is made) for the job opportunity until the end of the recruitment period
as specified in §655.102(f)(3).
(e) During the period of employment that is the subject of the labor certification application, the employer
will:
(1) Comply with applicable Federal, State and local employment-related laws and regulations, including
employment-related health and safety laws;
(2) Provide for or secure housing for those workers who are not reasonably able to return to their permanent
residence at the end of the work day, without charge to the worker, that complies with the applicable standards as set
forth in §655.104(d);

(3) Where required, has timely requested a preoccupancy inspection of the housing and, if one has been
conducted, received certification;
(4) Provide insurance, without charge to the worker, under a State workers' compensation law or otherwise,
that meets the requirements of §655.104(e); and
(5) Provide transportation in compliance with all applicable Federal, State or local laws and regulations
between the worker's living quarters (i.e., housing provided by the employer under §655.104(d)) and the employer's
worksite without cost to the worker.
(f) Upon the separation from employment of H-2A worker(s) employed under the labor certification
application, if such separation occurs prior to the end date of the employment specified in the application, the
employer will notify the Department and DHS in writing (or any other method specified by the Department or DHS)
of the separation from employment not later than 2 work days after such separation is discovered by the employer.
The procedures for reporting abandonments and abscondments are outlined in §655.104(n) of this subpart.
(g) The offered wage rate is the highest of the AEWR in effect at the time recruitment is initiated, the
prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, or the Federal or State minimum wage, and the employer will pay the offered
wage during the entire period of the approved labor certification.
(h) The offered wage is not based on commission, bonuses, or other incentives, unless the employer
guarantees a wage paid on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis that equals or exceeds the AEWR, prevailing
hourly wage or piece rate, or the legal Federal or State minimum wage, whichever is highest.
(i) The job opportunity is a full-time temporary position, calculated to be at least 30 hours per work week, the
qualifications for which do not substantially deviate from the normal and accepted qualifications required by
employers that do not use H-2A workers in the same or comparable occupations or crops.
(j) The employer has not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S. worker in the occupation
that is the subject of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification in the area of intended employment
except for lawful, job related reasons within 60 days of the date of need, or if the employer has laid off such
workers, it has offered the job opportunity that is the subject of the application to those laid-off U.S. worker(s) and
the U.S. worker(s) either refused the job opportunity or was rejected for the job opportunity for lawful, job-related
reasons.
(k) The employer has not and will not intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, or in any manner
discriminate against, and has not and will not cause any person to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, or
in any manner discriminate against, any person who has with just cause:
(1) Filed a complaint under or related to sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188, or this subpart or any other
Department regulation promulgated under sec. 218 of the INA;
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to sec. 218 of the INA, or this subpart
or any other Department regulation promulgated under sec. 218 of the INA;
(3) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to sec. 218 of the INA or this subpart or
any other Department regulation promulgated under sec. 218 of the INA;
(4) Consulted with an employee of a legal assistance program or an attorney on matters related to sec. 218 of
the INA or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated under sec. 218 of the INA; or
(5) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself/herself or others any right or protection afforded by sec. 218 of
the INA, or this subpart or any other Department regulation promulgated under sec. 218 of the INA.

(l) The employer shall not discharge any person because of that person's taking any action listed in paragraphs
(k)(1) through (k)(5) of this section.
(m) All fees associated with processing the temporary labor certification will be paid in a timely manner.
(n) The employer will inform H-2A workers of the requirement that they leave the U.S. at the end of the
period certified by the Department or separation from the employer, whichever is earlier, as required under
§655.111, unless the H-2A worker is being sponsored by another subsequent employer.
(o) The employer and its agents have not sought or received payment of any kind from the employee for any
activity related to obtaining labor certification, including payment of the employer's attorneys' fees, application fees,
or recruitment costs. For purposes of this paragraph, payment includes, but is not limited to, monetary payments,
wage concessions (including deductions from wages, salary, or benefits), kickbacks, bribes, tributes, in kind
payments, and free labor. This provision does not prohibit employers or their agents from receiving reimbursement
for costs that are the responsibility of the worker, such as government required passport or visa fees.
(p) The employer has contractually forbidden any foreign labor contractor or recruiter whom the employer
engages in international recruitment of H-2A workers to seek or receive payments from prospective employees,
except as provided for in DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A).
(q) The applicant is either a fixed-site employer, an agent or recruiter, an H-2ALC (as defined in these
regulations), or an association.
§655.1306 Assurances and obligations of H-2A Labor Contractors.
(a) The pre-filing activity requirements set forth in §655.102 are modified as follows for H-2ALCs:
(1) The job order for an H-2ALC may contain work locations in multiple areas of intended employment, and
may be submitted to any one of the SWAs having jurisdiction over the anticipated work areas. The SWA receiving
the job order shall promptly transmit, on behalf of the employer, a copy of its active job order to all States listed in
the application as anticipated worksites, as well as those States, if any, designated by the Secretary as traditional or
expected labor supply States for each area in which the employer's work is to be performed. Each SWA shall keep
the H-2ALC's job order posted until the end of the recruitment period, as set forth in §655.102(f)(3), for the area of
intended employment that is covered by the SWA. SWAs in States that have been designated as traditional or
expected labor supply States for more than one area of intended of employment that are listed on an application shall
keep the H-2ALC's job order posted until the end of the applicable recruitment period that is last in time, and may
make referrals for job opportunities in any area of intended employment that is still in an active recruitment period,
as defined by §655.102(f)(3).
(2) The H-2ALC must conduct separate positive recruitment under §655.102(g) through (i) for each area of
intended employment in which the H-2ALC intends to perform work, but need not conduct separate recruitment for
each work location within a single area of intended employment. The positive recruitment for each area of intended
employment must list the name and location of each fixed-site agricultural business to which the H-2ALC expects to
provide H-2A workers, the expected beginning and ending dates when the H-2ALC will be providing the workers to
each fixed site, and a description of the crops and activities the workers are expected to perform at such fixed site.
Such positive recruitment must be conducted pre-filing for the first area of intended employment, but must be
started no more than 75 and no fewer than 60 days before the listed arrival date (or the amended date, if applicable)
for each subsequent area of intended employment. For each area of intended employment, the advertising that must
be placed in any applicable States designated as traditional or expected labor supply States must be placed at the
same time as the placement of other positive recruitment for the area of intended employment in accordance with
§655.102(i)(2).
(3) The job order and the positive recruitment in each area of intended employment may require that workers
complete the remainder of the H-2ALC's itinerary.

(4) An H-2ALC who hires U.S. workers during the course of its itinerary, and accordingly releases one or
more of its H-2A workers, is eligible for the release from the three-quarters guarantee with respect to the released H2A workers that is provided for in §655.104(i)(4).
(5) An H-2ALC may amend its application subsequent to submission in accordance with §655.107(d)(3) to
account for new or changed worksites or areas of intended employment during the course of the itinerary in the
following manner:
(i) If the additional worksite(s) are in the same area(s) of intended employment as represented on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the H-2ALC is not required to re-recruit in those areas of
intended employment if that recruitment has been completed and if the job duties at the new work sites are similar to
those already covered by the application.
(ii) If the additional worksite(s) are outside the area(s) of intended employment represented on the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification, the H-2ALC must submit in writing the new area(s) of intended
employment and explain the reasons for the amendment of the labor certification itinerary. The CO will order
additional recruitment in accordance with §655.102(d).
(iii) For any additional worksite not included on the original application that necessitates a change in housing
of H-2A workers, the H-2ALC must secure the statement of housing as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section
and obtain an inspection of such housing from the SWA in the area of intended employment.
(iv) Where additional recruitment is required under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section, the CO
shall allow it to take place on an expedited basis, where possible, so as to allow the amended dates of need to be
met.
(6) Consistent with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, no later than 30 days prior to the commencement of
employment in each area of intended employment in the itinerary of an H-2ALC, the SWA having jurisdiction over
that area of intended employment must complete the housing inspections for any employer-provided housing to be
used by the employees of the H-2ALC.
(7) To satisfy the requirements of §655.102(h), the H-2ALC must contact all U.S employees that worked for
the H-2ALC during the previous season, except those excluded by that section, before filing its application, and
must advise those workers that a separate job opportunity exists for each area of intended employment that is
covered by the application. The employer may advise contacted employees that for any given job opportunity,
workers may be required to complete the remainder of the H-2ALC's itinerary.
(b) In addition to the assurances and obligations listed in §655.105, H-2ALC applicants are also required to:
(1) Provide the MSPA Farm Labor Contractor (FLC) certificate of registration number and expiration date if
required under MSPA at 29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., to have such a certificate;
(2) Identify the farm labor contracting activities the H-2ALC is authorized to perform as an FLC under MSPA
as shown on the FLC certificate of registration, if required under MSPA at 29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., to have such a
certificate of registration;
(3) List the name and location of each fixed-site agricultural business to which the H-2A Labor Contractor
expects to provide H-2A workers, the expected beginning and ending dates when the H-2ALC will be providing the
workers to each fixed site, and a description of the crops and activities the workers are expected to perform at such
fixed site;
(4) Provide proof of its ability to discharge financial obligations under the H-2A program by attesting that it
has obtained a surety bond as required by 29 CFR 501.8, stating on the application the name, address, phone

number, and contact person for the surety, and providing the amount of the bond (as calculated pursuant to 29 CFR
501.8) and any identifying designation utilized by the surety for the bond;
(5) Attest that it has engaged in, or will engage in within the timeframes required by §655.102 as modified by
§655.106(a), recruitment efforts in each area of intended employment in which it has listed a fixed-site agricultural
business; and
(6) Attest that it will be providing housing and transportation that complies with the applicable housing
standards in §655.104(d) or that it has obtained from each fixed-site agricultural business that will provide housing
or transportation to the workers a written statement stating that:
(i) All housing used by workers and owned, operated or secured by the fixed-site agricultural business
complies with the applicable housing standards in §655.104(d); and
(ii) All transportation between the worksite and the workers' living quarters that is provided by the fixed-site
agricultural business complies with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws and regulations and will provide, at a
minimum, the same vehicle safety standards, driver licensure, and vehicle insurance as required under 29 U.S.C.
1841 and 29 CFR part 500, subpart D, except where workers' compensation is used to cover such transportation as
described in §655.104(h)(3).
§655.1307 Processing of applications.
(a) Processing. (1) Upon receipt of the application, the CO will promptly review the application for
completeness and an absence of errors that would prevent certification, and for compliance with the criteria for
certification. The CO will make a determination to certify, deny, or issue a Notice of Deficiency prior to making a
Final Determination on the application. Applications requesting that zero job opportunities be certified for H-2A
employment because the employer has been able to recruit a sufficient number of U.S. workers must comply with
other requirements for H-2A applications and must be supported by a recruitment report, in which case the
application will be accepted but will then be denied. Criteria for certification, as used in this subpart, include, but are
not limited to, whether the employer has established the need for the agricultural services or labor to be performed
on a temporary or seasonal basis; made all the assurances and met all the obligations required by §655.105, and/or,
if an H-2ALC, by §655.106; complied with the timeliness requirements in §655.102; and complied with the
recruitment obligations required by §§655.102 and 655.103.
(2) Unless otherwise noted, any notice or request sent by the CO or OFLC to an applicant requiring a response
shall be sent by means normally assuring next-day delivery, to afford the applicant sufficient time to respond. The
employer's response shall be considered filed with the Department when sent (by mail, certified mail, or any other
means indicated to be acceptable by the CO) to the Department, which may be demonstrated, for example, by a
postmark.
(b) Notice of deficiencies. (1) If the CO determines that the employer has made all necessary attestations and
assurances, but the application fails to comply with one or more of the criteria for certification in paragraph (a) of
this section, the CO will promptly notify the employer within 7 calendar days of the CO's receipt of the application.
(2) The notice will:
(i) State the reason(s) why the application fails to meet the criteria for temporary labor certification, citing the
relevant regulatory standard(s);
(ii) Offer the employer an opportunity to submit a modified application within 5 business days from date of
receipt, stating the modification that is needed for the CO to accept the application for consideration;

(iii) Except as provided for under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, state that the CO's determination on
whether to grant or deny the Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be made no later than 30
calendar days before the date of need, provided that the employer submits the requested modification to the
application within 5 business days and in a manner specified by the CO;
(iv) Where the CO determines the employer failed to comply with the recruitment obligations required by
§§655.102 and 655.103, offer the employer an opportunity to correct its recruitment and conduct it on an expedited
schedule. The CO shall specify the positive recruitment requirements, request the employer submit proof of
corrected advertisement and an initial recruitment report meeting the requirements of §655.102(k) no earlier than 48
hours after the last corrected advertisement is printed, and state that the CO's determination on whether to grant or
deny the Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be made within 5 business days of receiving the
required documentation, which may be a date later than 30 days before the date of need:
(v) Offer the employer an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ, of the Notice of Deficiency. The notice will state that in order to obtain such a
review or hearing, the employer, within 5 business days of the receipt of the notice, must file by facsimile or other
means normally assuring next day delivery, a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge of DOL and
simultaneously serve a copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may submit any legal arguments
that the employer believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and
(vi) State that if the employer does not comply with the requirements under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iv) of
this section or request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing before an ALJ within the 5
business days the CO will deny the application in accordance with the labor certification determination provisions in
§655.109.
(c) Submission of modified applications. (1) If the CO notifies the employer of any deficiencies within the 7
calendar day timeframe set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the date by which the CO's Final Determination
is required by statute to be made will be postponed by 1 day for each day that passes beyond the 5 business-day
period allowed under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to submit a modified application.
(2) Where the employer submits a modified application as required by the CO, and the CO approves the
modified application, the CO will not deny the application based solely on the fact that it now does not meet the
timeliness requirements for filing applications.
(3) If the modified application is not approved, the CO will deny the application in accordance with the labor
certification determination provisions in §655.109.
(d) Amendments to applications. (1) Applications may be amended at any time before the CO's certification
determination to increase the number of workers requested in the initial application by not more than 20 percent (50
percent for employers requesting less than 10 workers) without requiring an additional recruitment period for U.S.
workers. Requests for increases above the percent prescribed, without additional recruitment, may be approved by
the CO only when the request is submitted in writing, the need for additional workers could not have been foreseen,
and the crops or commodities will be in jeopardy prior to the expiration of an additional recruitment period.
(2) Applications may be amended to make minor changes in the total period of employment, but only if a
written request is submitted to the CO and approved in advance. In considering whether to approve the request, the
CO will review the reason(s) for the request, determine whether the reason(s) are on the whole justified, and take
into account the effect(s) of a decision to approve on the adequacy of the underlying test of the domestic labor
market for the job opportunity. If a request for a change in the start date of the total period of employment is made
after workers have departed for the employer's place of work, the CO may only approve the change if the request is
accompanied by a written assurance signed and dated by the employer that all such workers will be provided
housing and subsistence, without cost to the workers, until work commences. Upon acceptance of an amendment,
the CO will submit to the SWA any necessary modification to the job order.

(3) Other amendments to the application, including elements of the job offer and the place of work, may be
approved by the CO if the CO determines the proposed amendment(s) are justified by a business reason and will not
prevent the CO from making the labor certification determination required under §655.109. Requested amendments
will be reviewed as quickly as possible, taking into account revised dates of need for work locations associated with
the amendment.
(e) Appeal procedures. With respect to either a Notice of Deficiency issued under paragraph (b) of this
section, the denial of a requested amendment under paragraph (d) of this section, or a notice of denial issued under
§655.109(e), if the employer timely requests an expedited administrative review or de novo hearing before an ALJ,
the procedures set forth in §655.115 will be followed.
§655.1308 Offered wage rate.
(a) Highest wage. To comply with its obligation under §655.105(g), an employer must offer a wage rate that is
the highest of the AEWR in effect at the time recruitment for a position is begun, the prevailing hourly wage or
piece rate, or the Federal or State minimum wage.
(b) Wage rate request. The employer must request and obtain a wage rate determination from the NPC, on a
form prescribed by ETA, before commencing any recruitment under this subpart, except where specifically
exempted from this requirement by these regulations.
(c) Validity of wage rate. The recruitment must begin within the validity period of the wage determination
obtained from the NPC. Recruitment for this purpose begins when the job order is accepted by the SWA for posting.
(d) Wage offer. The employer must offer and advertise in its recruitment a wage at least equal to the wage rate
required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(e) Adverse effect wage rate. The AEWR will be based on published wage data for the occupation, skill level,
and geographical area from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Occupational Employment Statistics (OES)
survey. The NPC will obtain wage information on the AEWR using the On-line Wage Library (OWL) found on the
Foreign Labor Certification Data Center Web site (http://www.flcdatacenter.com/). This wage shall not be less than
the July 24, 2009 Federal minimum wage of $7.25.
(f) Wage determination. The NPC must enter the wage rate determination on a form it uses, indicate the
source, and return the form with its endorsement to the employer.
(g) Skill level. (1) Level I wage rates are assigned to job offers for beginning level employees who have a basic
understanding of the occupation. These employees perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of
judgment. The tasks provide experience and familiarization with the employer's methods, practices, and programs.
The employees may perform higher level work for training and developmental purposes. These employees work
under close supervision and receive specific instructions on required tasks and results expected. Their work is
closely monitored and reviewed for accuracy.
(2) Level II wage rates are assigned to job offers for employees who have attained, through education or
experience, a good understanding of the occupation. These employees perform moderately complex tasks that
require limited judgment. An indicator that the job request warrants a wage determination at Level II would be a
requirement for years of education and/or experience that are generally required as described in the O*NET Job
Zones.
(3) Level III wage rates are assigned to job offers for employees who have a sound understanding of the
occupation and have attained, either through education or experience, special skills or knowledge. These employees
perform tasks that require exercising judgment and may coordinate the activities of other staff. They may have
supervisory authority over those staff. A requirement for years of experience or educational degrees that are at the

higher ranges indicated in the O*NET Job Zones would be an indicator that a Level III wage should be considered.
Frequently, key words in the job title can be used as indicators that an employer's job offer is for an experienced
worker. Words such as lead, senior, crew chief, or journeyman would be indicators that a Level III wage should be
considered.
(4) Level IV wage rates are assigned to job offers for employees who have sufficient experience in the
occupation to plan and conduct work requiring judgment and the independent evaluation, selection, modification,
and application of standard procedures and techniques. Such employees receive only minimal guidance and their
work is reviewed only for application of sound judgment and effectiveness in meeting the establishment's
procedures and expectations. They generally have management and/or supervisory responsibilities.
(h) Retention of documentation. An employer filing an Application for Temporary Employment Certification
must maintain documentation of its wage determination from the NPC as required in this subpart and be prepared to
submit this documentation with the filing of its application. The documentation required in this subpart must be
retained for a period of no less than 3 years from the date of the certification. There is no record retention
requirement for applications (and supporting documentation) that are denied.
§655.1309 Labor certification determinations.
(a) COs. The Administrator, OFLC is the Department's National CO. The Administrator, OFLC, and the
CO(s) in the NPC(s) (by virtue of delegation from the Administrator, OFLC), have the authority to certify or deny
applications for temporary employment certification under the H-2A nonimmigrant classification. If the
Administrator, OFLC has directed that certain types of temporary labor certification applications or specific
applications under the H-2A nonimmigrant classification be handled by the National OFLC, the Director(s) of the
NPC(s) will refer such applications to the Administrator, OFLC.
(b) Determination. No later than 30 calendar days before the date of need, as identified in the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, except as provided for under §655.107(c) for modified applications, or
applications not otherwise meeting certification criteria by that date, the CO will make a determination either to
grant or deny the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The CO will grant the application if and
only if: the employer has met the requirements of this subpart, including the criteria for certification set forth in
§655.107(a), and thus the employment of the H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working
conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
(c) Notification. The CO will notify the employer in writing (either electronically or by mail) of the labor
certification determination.
(d) Approved certification. If temporary labor certification is granted, the CO must send the certified
Application for Temporary Employment Certification and a Final Determination letter to the employer, or, if
appropriate, to the employer's agent or attorney. The Final Determination letter will notify the employer to file the
certified application and any other documentation required by USCIS with the appropriate USCIS office and to
continue to cooperate with the SWA by accepting all referrals of eligible U.S. workers who apply (or on whose
behalf an application is made) for the job opportunity until the end of the recruitment period as set forth in
§655.102(f)(3). However, the employer will not be required to accept referrals of eligible U.S. workers once it has
hired or extended employment offers to eligible U.S. workers equal to the number of H-2A workers sought.
(e) Denied certification. If temporary labor certification is denied, the Final Determination letter will be sent to
the employer by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The Final Determination Letter will:
(1) State the reasons certification is denied, citing the relevant regulatory standards and/or special procedures;
(2) If applicable, address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation as well as the prevailing benefits,
wages, and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers in the occupation and/or any applicable special
procedures;

(3) Offer the applicant an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review, or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ, of the denial. The notice must state that in order to obtain such a review or
hearing, the employer, within 7 calendar days of the date of the notice, must file by facsimile (fax), telegram, or
other means normally assuring next day delivery, a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge of DOL
(giving the address) and simultaneously serve a copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may
submit any legal arguments which the employer believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and
(4) State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing
before an ALJ within the 7 calendar days, the denial is final and the Department will not further consider that
application for temporary alien agricultural labor certification.
(f) Partial certification. The CO may, to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements, issue a partial
certification, reducing either the period of need or the number of H-2A workers being requested or both for
certification, based upon information the CO receives in the course of processing the temporary labor certification
application, an audit, or otherwise. The number of workers certified shall be reduced by one for each referred U.S.
worker who is qualified, able, available and willing. If a partial labor certification is issued, the Final Determination
letter will:
(1) State the reasons for which either the period of need and/or the number of H-2A workers requested has
been reduced, citing the relevant regulatory standards and/or special procedures;
(2) If applicable, address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation;
(3) Offer the applicant an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review, or a de novo
administrative hearing before an ALJ, of the decision. The notice will state that in order to obtain such a review or
hearing, the employer, within 7 calendar days of the date of the notice, will file by facsimile or other means
normally assuring next day delivery a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge of DOL (giving the
address) and simultaneously serve a copy on the CO. The notice will also state that the employer may submit any
legal arguments which the employer believes will rebut the basis of the CO's action; and
(4) State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing
before an ALJ within the 7 calendar days, the denial is final and the Department will not further consider that
application for temporary alien agricultural labor certification.
(g) Appeal procedures. If the employer timely requests an expedited administrative review or de novo hearing
before an ALJ under paragraph (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section, the procedures at §655.115 will be followed.
(h) Payment of processing fees. A determination by the CO to grant an Application for Temporary
Employment Certification in whole or in part under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section will include a bill for the
required fees. Each employer of H-2A workers under the Application for Temporary Employment Certification
(except joint employer associations, which shall not be assessed a fee in addition to the fees assessed to the members
of the association) must pay in a timely manner a non-refundable fee upon issuance of the certification granting the
application (in whole or in part), as follows:
(1) Amount. The application fee for each employer receiving a temporary agricultural labor certification is
$100 plus $10 for each H-2A worker certified under the Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
provided that the fee to an employer for each temporary agricultural labor certification received will be no greater
than $1,000. There is no additional fee to the association filing the application. The fees must be paid by check or
money order made payable to “United States Department of Labor.” In the case of H-2A employers that are
members of an agricultural association acting as a joint employer applying on their behalf, the aggregate fees for all
employers of H-2A workers under the application must be paid by one check or money order.

(2) Timeliness. Fees received by the CO no more than 30 days after the date the temporary labor certification
is granted will be considered timely. Non-payment of fees by the date that is 30 days after the issuance of the
certification will be considered a substantial program violation and subject to the procedures in §655.115.
§655.1310 Validity and scope of temporary labor certifications.
(a) Validity period. A temporary labor certification is valid for the duration of the job opportunity for which
certification is granted to the employer. Except as provided in paragraph and (d) of this section, the validity period is
that time between the beginning and ending dates of certified employment, as listed on the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification. The certification expires on the last day of authorized employment.
(b) Scope of validity. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a temporary labor
certification is valid only for the number of H-2A workers, the area of intended employment, the specific occupation
and duties, and the employer(s) specified on the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification (as
originally filed or as amended) and may not be transferred from one employer to another.
(c) Scope of validity—associations—(1) Certified applications. If an association is requesting temporary labor
certification as a joint employer, the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be granted
jointly to the association and to each of the association's employer members named on the application. Workers
authorized by the temporary labor certification may be transferred among its certified employer members to perform
work for which the temporary labor certification was granted, provided the association controls the assignment of
such workers and maintains a record of such assignments. All temporary agricultural labor certifications to
associations may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its employer members named on the
application. If an association is requesting temporary labor certification as a sole employer, the certified Application
for Temporary Employment Certification is granted to the association only.
(2) Ineligible employer-members. Workers may not be transferred or referred to an association's employer
member if that employer member has been debarred from participation in the H-2A program.
(d) Extensions on period of employment—(1) Short-term extension. An employer who seeks an extension of 2
weeks or less of the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification must apply for such extension to
DHS. If DHS grants the extension, the corresponding Application for Temporary Employment Certification will be
deemed extended for such period as is approved by DHS.
(2) Long-term extension. For extensions beyond 2 weeks, an employer may apply to the CO at any time for an
extension of the period of employment on the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification for
reasons related to weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the employer (which may include
unforeseen changes in market conditions), provided that the employer's need for an extension is supported in
writing, with documentation showing that the extension is needed and that the need could not have been reasonably
foreseen by the employer. The CO will grant or deny the request for extension of the period of employment on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification based on the available information, and will notify the
employer of the decision in writing. The employer may appeal a denial for a request of an extension in accordance
with the procedures contained in §655.115. The CO will not grant an extension where the total work contract period
under that application and extensions would be 12 months or more, except in extraordinary circumstances.
(e) Requests for determinations based on nonavailability of able, willing, available, eligible, and qualified
U.S. workers—(1) Standards for requests. If a temporary labor certification has been partially granted or denied
based on the CO's determination that able, willing, available, eligible, and qualified U.S. workers are available, and,
on or after 30 calendar days before the date of need, some or all of those U.S. workers are, in fact, no longer able,
willing, eligible, qualified, or available, the employer may request a new temporary labor certification determination
from the CO. Prior to making a new determination the CO will promptly ascertain (which may be through the SWA
or other sources of information on U.S. worker availability) whether specific able, willing, eligible and qualified
replacement U.S. workers are available or can be reasonably expected to be present at the employer's establishment
within 72 hours from the date the employer's request was received. The CO will expeditiously, but in no case later

than 72 hours after the time a complete request (including the signed statement included in paragraph (e)(2) of this
section) is received, make a determination on the request. An employer may appeal a denial of such a determination
in accordance with the procedures contained in §655.115.
(2) Unavailability of U.S. workers. The employer's request for a new determination must be made directly to
the CO by telephone or electronic mail, and must be confirmed by the employer in writing as required by this
paragraph. If the employer telephonically or via electronic mail requests the new determination by asserting solely
that U.S. workers have become unavailable, the employer must submit to the CO a signed statement confirming
such assertion. If such signed statement is not received by the CO within 72 hours of the CO's receipt of the request
for a new determination, the CO will deny the request.
(3) Notification of determination. If the CO determines that U.S. workers have become unavailable and cannot
identify sufficient specific able, willing, eligible, and qualified U.S. workers who are or who are likely to be
available, the CO will grant the employer's request for a new determination. However, this does not preclude an
employer from submitting subsequent requests for new determinations, if warranted, based on subsequent facts
concerning purported nonavailability of U.S. workers or referred workers not being eligible workers or not able,
willing, or qualified because of lawful job-related reasons.
§655.1311 Required departure.
(a) Limit to worker's stay. As defined further in DHS regulations, a temporary labor certification limits the
authorized period of stay for an H-2A worker. See 8 CFR 214.2(h). A foreign worker may not remain beyond his or
her authorized period of stay, as established by DHS, which is based upon the validity period of the labor
certification under which the H-2A worker is employed, nor beyond separation from employment prior to
completion of the H-2A contract, absent an extension or change of such worker's status under DHS regulations.
(b) Notice to worker. Upon establishment of a program by DHS for registration of departure, an employer
must notify any H-2A worker that when the worker departs the U.S. by land at the conclusion of employment as
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the worker must register such departure at the place and in the manner
prescribed by DHS.
§655.1312 Audits.
(a) Discretion. The Department will conduct audits of temporary labor certification applications for which
certification has been granted. The applications selected for audit will be chosen within the sole discretion of the
Department.
(b) Audit letter. Where an application is selected for audit, the CO will issue an audit letter to the
employer/applicant. The audit letter will:
(1) State the documentation that must be submitted by the employer;
(2) Specify a date, no fewer than 14 days and no more than 30 days from the date of the audit letter, by which
the required documentation must be received by the CO; and
(3) Advise that failure to comply with the audit process may result in a finding by the CO to:
(i) Revoke the labor certification as provided in §655.117 and/or
(ii) Debar the employer from future filings of H-2A temporary labor certification applications as provided in
§655.118.

(c) Supplemental information request. During the course of the audit examination, the CO may request
supplemental information and/or documentation from the employer in order to complete the audit.
(d) Audit violations. If, as a result of the audit, the CO determines the employer failed to produce required
documentation, or determines that the employer violated the standards set forth in §655.117(a) with respect to the
application, the employer's labor certification may be revoked under §655.117 and/or the employer may be referred
for debarment under §655.118. The CO may determine to provide the audit findings and underlying documentation
to DHS or another appropriate enforcement agency. The CO shall refer any findings that an employer discouraged
an eligible U.S. worker from applying, or failed to hire, discharged, or otherwise discriminated against an eligible
U.S. worker, to the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office of Special Counsel for Unfair Immigration
Related Employment Practices.
§655.1313 H-2A applications involving fraud or willful misrepresentation.
(a) Referral for investigation. If the CO discovers possible fraud or willful misrepresentation involving an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification the CO may refer the matter to the DHS and the Department's
Office of the Inspector General for investigation.
(b) Terminated processing. If a court or the DHS determines that there was fraud or willful misrepresentation
involving an Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the application will be deemed invalid. The
determination is not appealable. If a certification has been granted, a finding under this paragraph will be cause to
revoke the certification.
§655.1314 Setting meal charges; petition for higher meal charges.
(a) Meal charges. Until a new amount is set under this paragraph an employer may charge workers up to $9.90
for providing them with three meals per day. The maximum charge allowed by this paragraph (a) will be changed
annually by the same percentage as the 12 month percentage change for the Consumer Price Index for all Urban
Consumers for Food between December of the year just concluded and December of the year prior to that. The
annual adjustments will be effective on the date of their publication by the Administrator, OFLC, as a Notice in the
FEDERAL REGISTER. When a charge or deduction for the cost of meals would bring the employee's wage below the
minimum wage set by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. 206 (FLSA), the charge or deduction must meet the requirements of
29 U.S.C. 203(m) of the FLSA, including the recordkeeping requirements found at 29 CFR 516.27.
(b) Filing petitions for higher meal charges. The employer may file a petition with the CO to charge more
than the applicable amount for meal charges if the employer justifies the charges and submits to the CO the
documentation required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(1) Required documentation. Documentation submitted must include the cost of goods and services directly
related to the preparation and serving of meals, the number of workers fed, the number of meals served and the
number of days meals were provided. The cost of the following items may be included: Food; kitchen supplies other
than food, such as lunch bags and soap; labor costs that have a direct relation to food service operations, such as
wages of cooks and dining hall supervisors; fuel, water, electricity, and other utilities used for the food service
operation; and other costs directly related to the food service operation. Charges for transportation, depreciation,
overhead and similar charges may not be included. Receipts and other cost records for a representative pay period
must be retained and must be available for inspection by the CO for a period of 1 year.
(2) Effective date for higher charge. The employer may begin charging the higher rate upon receipt of a
favorable decision from the CO unless the CO sets a later effective date in the decision.
(c) Appeal. In the event the employer's petition for a higher meal charge is denied in whole or in part, the
employer may appeal the denial. Appeals will be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge. ALJ's will hear
such appeals according to the procedures in 29 CFR part 18, except that the appeal will not be considered as a
complaint to which an answer is required. The decision of the ALJ is the final decision of the Secretary.

§655.1315 Administrative review and de novo hearing before an administrative law judge.
(a) Administrative review—(1) Consideration. Whenever an employer has requested an administrative review
before an ALJ of a decision by the CO: Not to accept for consideration an Application for Temporary Employment
Certification; to deny an Application for Temporary Employment Certification; to deny an amendment of an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification; or to deny an extension of an Application for Temporary
Employment Certification, the CO will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief Administrative Law
Judge by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will immediately assign
an ALJ (which may be a panel of such persons designated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge from BALCA
established by 20 CFR part 656, which will hear and decide the appeal as set forth in this section) to review the
record for legal sufficiency. The ALJ may not remand the case and may not receive evidence in addition to what the
CO used to make the determination.
(2) Decision. Within 5 business days after receipt of the ETA case file the ALJ will, on the basis of the written
record and after due consideration of any written submissions (which may not include new evidence) from the
parties involved or amici curiae, either affirm, reverse, or modify the CO's decision by written decision. The
decision of the ALJ must specify the reasons for the action taken and must be immediately provided to the
employer, the CO, the Administrator, OFLC, and DHS by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's
decision is the final decision of the Secretary.
(b) De novo hearing. (1) Request for hearing; conduct of hearing. Whenever an employer has requested a de
novo hearing before an ALJ of a decision by the CO: Not to accept for consideration an Application for Temporary
Employment Certification; to deny an Application for Temporary Employment Certification; to deny an amendment
of an Application for Temporary Employment Certification; or to deny an extension of an Application for
Temporary Employment Certification, the CO will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief
Administrative Law Judge by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will
immediately assign an ALJ (which may be a panel of such persons designated by the Chief Administrative Law
Judge from BALCA established by 20 CFR part 656 of this chapter, but which will hear and decide the appeal as
provided in this section) to conduct the de novo hearing. The procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to such hearings,
except that:
(i) The appeal will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is required;
(ii) The ALJ will ensure that the hearing is scheduled to take place within 5 calendar days after the ALJ's
receipt of the ETA case file, if the employer so requests, and will allow for the introduction of new evidence; and
(iii) The ALJ's decision must be rendered within 10 calendar days after the hearing.
(2) Decision. After a de novo hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the CO's determination, and the
ALJ's decision must be provided immediately to the employer, CO, Administrator, OFLC, and DHS by means
normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final decision of the Secretary.
§655.1316 Job Service Complaint System; enforcement of work contracts.
(a) Complaints arising under this subpart may be filed through the Job Service Complaint System, as
described in 20 CFR part 658, Subpart E. Complaints which involve worker contracts must be referred by the SWA
to ESA for appropriate handling and resolution, as described in 29 CFR part 501. As part of this process, ESA may
report the results of its investigation to the Administrator, OFLC for consideration of employer penalties or such
other action as may be appropriate.
(b) Complaints alleging that an employer discouraged an eligible U.S. worker from applying, failed to hire,
discharged, or otherwise discriminated against an eligible U.S. worker, or discovered violations involving the same,
may be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office of Special Counsel for Unfair
Immigration Related Employment Practices (OSC), in addition to any activity, investigation, and/or enforcement

action taken by ETA or an SWA. Likewise, if OSC becomes aware of a violation of these regulations, it may
provide such information to the appropriate SWA and the CO.
§655.1317 Revocation of approved labor certifications.
(a) Basis for DOL revocation. The CO, in consultation with the Administrator, OFLC, may revoke a
temporary agricultural labor certification approved under this subpart, if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing
(or failure to file rebuttal evidence), it is found that any of the following violations were committed with respect to
that temporary agricultural labor certification:
(1) The CO finds that issuance of the temporary agricultural labor certification was not justified due to a
willful misrepresentation on the application;
(2) The CO finds that the employer:
(i) Willfully violated a material term or condition of the approved temporary agricultural labor certification or
the H-2A regulations, unless otherwise provided under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section; or
(ii) Failed, after notification, to cure a substantial violation of the applicable housing standards set out in 20
CFR 655.104(d); or
(iii) Significantly failed to cooperate with a DOL investigation or with a DOL official performing an
investigation, inspection, or law enforcement function under sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or
29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual obligations); or
(iv) Failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the ESA for violation(s) of
obligations found by that agency, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court order secured
by the Secretary under sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or 29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of
contractual obligations).
(3) The CO determines after a recommendation is made by the WHD ESA in accordance with 29 CFR 501.20,
which governs when a recommendation of revocation may be made to ETA, that the conduct complained of upon
examination meets the standards of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section; or
(4) If a court or the DHS, or, as a result of an audit, the CO, determines that there was fraud or willful
misrepresentation involving the Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(b) DOL procedures for revocation. (1) The CO will send to the employer (and his attorney or agent) a Notice
of Intent to Revoke by means normally ensuring next-day delivery, which will contain a detailed statement of the
grounds for the proposed revocation and the time period allowed for the employer's rebuttal. The employer may
submit evidence in rebuttal within 14 calendar days of the date the notice is issued. The CO must consider all
relevant evidence presented in deciding whether to revoke the temporary agricultural labor certification.
(2) If rebuttal evidence is not timely filed by the employer, the Notice of Intent to Revoke will become the final
decision of the Secretary and take effect immediately at the end of the 14-day period.
(3) If, after reviewing the employer's timely filed rebuttal evidence, the CO finds that the employer more
likely than not meets one or more of the bases for revocation under §655.117(a), the CO will notify the employer, by
means normally ensuring next-day delivery, within 14 calendar days after receiving such timely filed rebuttal
evidence, of his/her final determination that the temporary agricultural labor certification should be revoked. The
CO's notice will contain a detailed statement of the bases for the decision, and must offer the employer an
opportunity to request a hearing. The notice must state that, to obtain such a hearing, the employer must, within 10
calendar days of the date of the notice file a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, United States

Department of Labor, 800 K Street, NW., Suite 400-N, Washington, DC 20001-8002, and simultaneously serve a
copy to the Administrator, OFLC. The timely filing of a request for a hearing will stay the revocation pending the
outcome of the hearing.
(c) Hearing. (1) Within 5 business days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the CO will send a certified
copy of the ETA case file to the Chief Administrative Law Judge by means normally assuring next-day delivery.
The Chief Administrative Law Judge will immediately assign an ALJ to conduct the hearing. The procedures in 29
CFR part 18 apply to such hearings, except that:
(i) The request for a hearing will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is required;
(ii) The ALJ will ensure that the hearing is scheduled to take place within 15 calendar days after the ALJ's
receipt of the ETA case file, if the employer so requests, and will allow for the introduction of new evidence; and
(iii) The ALJ's decision must be rendered within 20 calendar days after the hearing.
(2) Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the CO's determination. The ALJ's
decision must be provided immediately to the employer, CO, Administrator, OFLC, DHS, and DOS by means
normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final decision of the Secretary.
(d) Employer's obligations in the event of revocation. If an employer's temporary agricultural labor
certification is revoked under this section, and the workers have departed the place of recruitment, the employer will
be responsible for:
(1) Reimbursement of actual inbound transportation and subsistence expenses, as if the worker meets the
requirements for payment under §655.104(h)(1);
(2) The worker's outbound transportation expenses, as if the worker meets the requirements for payment under
§655.104(h)(2);
(3) Payment to the worker of the amount due under the three-fourths guarantee as required by §655.104(i); and
(4) Any other wages, benefits, and working conditions due or owing to the worker under these regulations.
§655.1318 Debarment.
(a) The Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications under this subpart to an employer and
any successor in interest to the debarred employer, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section,
if:
(1) The Administrator, OFLC finds that the employer substantially violated a material term or condition of its
temporary labor certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers; and
(2) The Administrator, OFLC issues a Notice of Intent to Debar no later than 2 years after the occurrence of
the violation.
(b) The Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications under this subpart to an employer
represented by an agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
(1) The Administrator, OFLC finds that the agent or attorney participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason
to know of, an employer's substantial violation; and

(2) The Administrator, OFLC issues the agent or attorney a Notice of Intent to Debar no later than 2 years
after the occurrence of the violation.
(c) No employer, attorney, or agent may be debarred under this subpart for more than 3 years.
(d) For the purposes of this section, a substantial violation includes:
(1) A pattern or practice of acts of commission or omission on the part of the employer or the employer's agent
which:
(i) Are significantly injurious to the wages or benefits required to be offered under the H-2A program, or
working conditions of a significant number of the employer's U.S. or H-2A workers; or
(ii) Reflect a significant failure to offer employment to all qualified domestic workers who applied for the job
opportunity for which certification was being sought, except for lawful job-related reasons; or
(iii) Reflect a willful failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers as set forth in
this subpart; or
(iv) Reflect a significant failure to comply with the audit process in violation of §655.112; or
(v) Reflect the employment of an H-2A worker outside the area of intended employment, or in an
activity/activities, not listed in the job order (other than an activity minor and incidental to the activity/activities
listed in the job order), or after the period of employment specified in the job order and any approved extension;
(2) The employer's persistent or prolonged failure to pay the necessary fee in a timely manner, following the
issuance of a deficiency notice to the applicant and allowing for a reasonable period for response;
(3) Fraud involving the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or a response to an audit;
(4) A significant failure to cooperate with a DOL investigation or with a DOL official performing an

29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual obligations); or
(5) A significant failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the ESA for
violation(s) of obligations found by that agency (if applicable), or with one or more decisions or orders of the
Secretary or a court order secured by the Secretary under sec. 218 of the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or 29
CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual obligations); or
(6) A single heinous act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program
requirements cannot reasonably be expected.
(e) DOL procedures for debarment under this section will be as follows:
(1) The Administrator, OFLC will send to the employer, attorney, or agent a Notice of Intent to Debar by
means normally ensuring next-day delivery, which will contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the proposed
debarment. The employer, attorney or agent may submit evidence in rebuttal within 14 calendar days of the date the
notice is issued. The Administrator, OFLC must consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding whether to
debar the employer, attorney, or agent.
(2) If rebuttal evidence is not timely filed by the employer, attorney, or agent, the Notice of Intent to Debar
will become the final decision of the Secretary and take effect immediately at the end of the 14-day period.

(3) If, after reviewing the employer's timely filed rebuttal evidence, the Administrator, OFLC determines that
the employer, attorney, or agent more likely than not meets one or more of the bases for debarment under
§655.118(d), the Administrator, OFLC will notify the employer, by means normally ensuring next-day delivery,
within 14 calendar days after receiving such timely filed rebuttal evidence, of his/her final determination of
debarment and of the employer, attorney, or agent's right to appeal.
(4) The Notice of Debarment must be in writing, must state the reason for the debarment finding, including a
detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment, and must offer the employer, attorney, or
agent an opportunity to request a hearing. The notice must state that, to obtain such a hearing, the debarred party
must, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, file a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge,
United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street, NW., Suite 400-N, Washington, DC 20001-8002, and
simultaneously serve a copy to the Administrator, OFLC. The debarment will take effect 30 days from the date the
Notice of Debarment is issued unless a request for a hearing is properly filed within 30 days from the date the Notice
of Debarment is issued. The timely filing of the request for a hearing stays the debarment pending the outcome of
the hearing.
(5)(i) Hearing. Within 10 days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the Administrator, OFLC will send a
certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief Administrative Law Judge by means normally assuring next-day
delivery. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will immediately assign an ALJ to conduct the hearing. The
procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to such hearings, except that the request for a hearing will not be considered to
be a complaint to which an answer is required;
(ii) Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the Administrator, OFLC 's
determination. The ALJ's decision must be provided immediately to the employer, Administrator, OFLC, DHS, and
DOS by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final decision of the Secretary, unless
either party, within 30 calendar days of the ALJ's decision, seeks review of the decision with the Administrative
Review Board (ARB).
(iii) Review by the ARB.
(A) Any party wishing review of the decision of an ALJ must, within 30 days of the decision of the ALJ,
petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition must be served on all parties and on the ALJ. The
ARB must decide whether to accept the petition within 30 days of receipt. If the ARB declines to accept the petition
or if the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition within 30 days after the receipt of a timely filing of the
petition, the decision of the ALJ shall be deemed the final agency action. If a petition for review is accepted, the
decision of the ALJ shall be stayed unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the decision. The ARB must
serve notice of its decision to accept or not to accept the petition upon the ALJ and upon all parties to the proceeding
in person or by certified mail.
(B) Upon receipt of the ARB's notice to accept the petition, the Office of Administrative Law Judges shall
promptly forward a copy of the complete hearing record to the ARB.
(C) Where the ARB has determined to review such decision and order, the ARB shall notify each party of:
(1) The issue or issues raised;
(2) The form in which submissions shall be made (i.e., briefs, oral argument, etc.); and
(3) The time within which such presentation shall be submitted.
(D) The ARB's final decision must be issued within 90 days from the notice granting the petition and served
upon all parties and the ALJ, in person or by certified mail. If the ARB fails to provide a decision within 90 days
from the notice granting the petition, the ALJ's decision will be the final decision of the Secretary.

(f) Debarment involving members of associations. If the Administrator, OFLC determines a substantial
violation has occurred, and if an individual employer-member of an agricultural association acting as a joint
employer is determined to have committed the violation, the debarment determination will apply only to that
member of the association unless the Administrator, OFLC determines that the association or other association
members participated in the violation, in which case the debarment will be invoked against the complicit association
or other association members.
(g) Debarment involving agricultural associations acting as joint employers. If the Administrator, OFLC
determines a substantial violation has occurred, and if an agricultural association acting as a joint employer with its
members is found to have committed the violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the association,
and will not be applied to any individual employer-member of the association unless the Administrator, OFLC
determines that the member participated in the violation, in which case the debarment will be invoked against any
complicit association members as well. An association debarred from the H-2A temporary labor certification
program will not be permitted to continue to file as a joint employer with its members during the period of the
debarment.
(h) Debarment involving agricultural associations acting as sole employers. If the Administrator, OFLC
determines a substantial violation has occurred, and if an agricultural association acting as a sole employer is
determined to have committed the violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the association and any
successor in interest to the debarred association.
§655.1319 Document retention requirements.
