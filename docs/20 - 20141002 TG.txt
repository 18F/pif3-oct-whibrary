CHAPTER 20 - AGRICULTURE, RELATED AND SEASONAL
EXEMPTIONS
20a - EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE - FLSA SECS 13(a)(6)
AND 13(b)(12)
20a00 - General.
Reg 526 and IB 780 contain the basic interpretations regarding the agriculture and
related exemptions. Chapter 20 supplements these interpretations.
20a06 - Responsibility for compliance by independent contractors on farms.
Where it is clear that certain agricultural operations performed on a farm are
performed for the farmer by a bona fide independent contractor, the independent
contractor will be tested for coverage in his own right and considered responsible
for MW compliance with respect to his own employees. (However, see IB
780.305(c) and 780.331(d).)
20a07 - Application of Sec 3(m) and Reg 531 on farms.
In many instances, farm workers are furnished their meals, lodging, and other
facilities. In the ordinary case, for purposes of applying Sec 3(m) (Reg 531), the
employer may treat as wages the reasonable cost or fair value of board, housing,
fuel, and a garden plot furnished the employee. Where such facilities as a house
and garden plot are furnished to a family that has several members working on the
employer’s farm during the year, no more than the amount representing the
reasonable cost to the employer, or the fair value, can be charged to the entire
family occupying the house.
20a08 - Sharecroppers and tenant farmers.
Numerous questions have arisen as to the employee-employer relationship in
agriculture where sharecropping arrangements or landlord-tenant agreement
provide for shares of crops as rental payments in farm operations. Sample
situations and comments thereon have been prepared for guidance in resolving
such question. These are included, with an explanation, in WH Publication 1187
which is filed in FOH Vol. I. (See also IB 780.330.)

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

20a

20a10 - Effect on Sec 13(a)(6) of Sec 13(g) - "Conglomerates".
(a) The MW exemption component of Sec 13(a)(6) does not apply with respect to
any employee employed by an establishment which is part of a "conglomerate" as
defined in Sec 13(g). (See FOH 25o.) This exception applies to employment
under all Subs, i.e., A, B, C, D, E, of Sec 13(a)(6).
(b) A small experimental farm operated or controlled by an agribusiness
"conglomerate" or a ranch controlled by a conglomerate are illustrative of the
types of situations which may be within the Sec 13(g) exception.
(c) Employment in "agriculture" outside of Sec 13(a)(6) because of Sec 13(g) is
subject to the MW rate provided by Sec 6(a)(5), i.e., $2.20 per hour in calendar
year 1977 and the Sec 6(a)(1) rate thereafter. Sec 13(g) has no effect on the Sec
13(b)(12) OT exemption.

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

20b

20b - EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE
20b01 - "Off-farm" driving.
Workers not employed by the farmer, such as the harvesting crew of a canner,
processor, packer, or independent contractor, or employees of a "chicken factory"
or hatchery, are employed in "agriculture" if they are employed "on a farm" in
duties which constitute "primary" or "secondary" agriculture as defined in IB 780,
Subpart B. The fact that a minor or incidental part of the work of such employees
occurs off the farm will not change the situation. This is true, for example, where
a small amount of time within the w/w is spent by an employee in transporting
equipment or other employees to and from the farm or between farms, or where
the "off-farm" driving is isolated or sporadic.
20b02 - Field packers not employed by the farmer.
(a) Employees not employed by the farmer (such as employees of a shipper, packer,
or independent harvesting contractor) are employed in "agriculture" if they are
engaged in "field packing" lettuce, celery, asparagus, cabbage, or other vegetables
involving closely comparable packing operations.
(b) ”Field packing" by such employees must be performed either in the field or on the
edge of the field where the vegetables are grown, and without a substantial lapse
of time between harvesting and packing. Included in this term are such operations
as: setting up or distributing packing containers; sorting, trimming and washing
the vegetables; placing the vegetables in containers; closing or fastening the
containers; cooling (but not freezing) the vegetables; and loading. Operations
performed away from the field or its edge, including transportation to market or to
shipping points, unloading, cooling or reloading are not within the meaning of
"field packing" and are not considered "agriculture".
(c) Where such employees are engaged in "field packing" vegetables in situations not
closely comparable to packing lettuce, celery, asparagus, or cabbage, or in "field
packing" fresh fruits, the question shall be referred to the Adm.
20b03 - Stripping of tobacco in an independent warehouse.
(a) The stripping of tobacco in an independent warehouse that prepares the crop for
market is not a practice performed "by a farmer" if performed by employees of
the warehouse, even though the warehouse employs as strippers, the farmers who

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20b

grew the tobacco. In a situation where tobacco farmers and their tenants exchange
services in stripping tobacco grown by them, careful examination of the
arrangement is necessary to determine whether the strippers:
(1) Are individually employed in turn by each farmer (in which event they
would be considered as employed in "agriculture", if the stripping
performed for each farmer is a subordinate part of his activities), or
(2) Are employed by the warehouse (in which event the stripping is not
performed "by a farmer"), or
(3) Are jointly employed by the several farmers (in which event it cannot be
said that the stripping is incidental to any particular farmer’s farming
operations, and they would not be considered as employed in
"agriculture").
(4) However, see Sec 7(m) and FOH Secs 20i00, 20t00, and 20t01.
20b04 - Fish farming.
Fish farming is included in the term "farming in all its branches" and an employee
performing such activities is engaged in agriculture within the meaning of Sec
3(f) (see IB 780.109 and 780.120). The possibility of exemption under Sec
13(a)(5) or a combination of exemptions should not be overlooked (see FOH
25d02 and IB 784).
20b05 - Employees of nurseries or florists engaged in caring for plants obtained
from other growers.
(a) In some cases nursery operators and florists purchase or secure agricultural or
horticultural commodities, such as rooted cuttings or young plants, from others
and it becomes necessary to determine whether the activities of particular
employees in connection with these commodities constitute primary agriculture,
i.e., "cultivation, growing.. . ." within the meaning of Sec 3(f). In making such a
determination it is necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances including
whether the operations performed on the plants are calculated to produce growth
to maturity or substantial maturity or whether the operations are merely designed
to care for and preserve the plants while they are on the employer’s premises.
Among the factors to be considered are:

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20b

(1) The stage of development of the plant at the time it is obtained, i.e.,
whether it is immature, substantially mature or fully matured; and
(2) The nature and purpose of operations performed on the plant; and
(3) The length of time the plant is retained from the time it is obtained to the
time of sale or other disposition and its stage of development at the time.
(b) The principles set forth in (a) above are not hard and fast rules but must be
applied in the total fact situation to aid in determining the actual purpose and
result of the activities engaged in by the employees. The following examples will
serve to illustrate the application of these principles. Where plants are received in
a state of substantial maturity and are merely potted and preserved for a short
period of time prior to sale or other disposition, the activities of employees
engaged in caring for such plants would not be considered "cultivation" or
"growing" within the primary definition of agriculture. This would be the case
where substantially mature trees and shrubs from other nurseries are planted or
"healed in" for later use in landscaping operations. On the other hand, where
rooted cuttings or young plants are received and require substantial growth to
reach maturity and where a root system must be developed and regular and
intensive care such as spraying, watering, and fertilizing must be performed, the
activities of employees performing such operations will be considered as
"cultivation" or "growing" within the definition. (See also IB 780.205-.209.)
20b06 - Christmas trees.
Christmas trees, whether wild or planted, are not "agricultural or horticultural
commodities" as these terms are used in Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.115.). Consequently
the planting, tending, cutting, and trimming of Christmas trees does not constitute
"primary agriculture" (see IB 780.208). Activities in connection with Christmas
trees may be considered "secondary agriculture", however. (See IB 780-.203.)
The possibility of exemption under Sec 13(b)(28) should not be overlooked (see
IB 788 and FOH 25e).
20b07 - Pine straw.
(a) Pine straw is the fresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine
trees. It is produced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and
groundcover. The raking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20b

commercial purposes is usually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine
trees being grown for forestry and lumbering operations.
(b) Based on the plain language of the statute, forestry and lumbering operations are
not considered primary agriculture.
(c) Pine straw activities generally will not qualify as secondary agriculture, unless all
the activities are performed by a farmer or on a farm in conjunction with the other
farming operations.
(d) Since pine straw activities typically do not qualify as primary or secondary
agriculture, the minimum wage and overtime pay protections of the FLSA will
apply to most pine straw workers.
(e) Section 13(b)(28) exempts from overtime pay “any employee employed in
planting or tending trees, cruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or
transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad,
or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his
employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.” Pine
straw workers are typically employed in the forestry or lumbering operations
described in this exemption because pine straw is a natural substance of trees and
therefore a “forestry product.” See 29 USC 213(b)(28). Pine straw workers will
therefore qualify for the Section 13(b)(28) exemption when the employer employs
eight or fewer pine straw workers.
(f) The FLSA agricultural child labor standards, allowing pine straw workers under
the age of 16 to perform all pine straw activities except operating and assisting in
operation of a forklift, would generally only apply to pine straw activities if they
qualified as secondary agriculture. The FLSA child labor provisions for
nonagricultural work prohibit pine straw workers under the age of 16 from
employment in pine straw activities and prohibit those who are 16 and 17 years
old from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven hoisting devices,
such as forklifts, backhoes, and skid steer loaders.
(g) Since pine straw activities generally do not qualify as agriculture under the FLSA,
employers may continue to utilize the H-2B temporary worker program as
opposed to the H-2A temporary worker program.

20c

20c - OUTSIDE BUYER OF POULTRY, EGGS, CREAM, OR MILK - FLSA SEC
13(b)(5)
20c00 - General provisions of Sec 13(b)(5) exemption.
Sec 13(b)(5) provides that the OT provisions of the FLSA shall not apply to any
individual employed as an outside buyer of poultry, eggs, cream, or milk in their
raw or natural state.
20c01 - Meaning of term "outside buyer".
(a) The term "outside buyer" as used in Sec 13(b)(5) refers only to employees who
are engaged in buying or contracting to buy, and who are regularly performing
these functions away from their employer’s place of business. The term does not
include buyers who are located and perform their work in fixed establishments,
usually known as buying stations, which are located in the country or in small
rural communities away from the main plant where the goods are processed. Sec
13(b)(5) describes an occupation, rather than specific operations, as the basis of
exemption for the employees involved.
(b) The exemption applies to an employee who has as his or her chief duty or primary
function buying, in the sense of obtaining and soliciting commitments from the
persons on whom he calls, to sell the named commodities. Such an employee will
be exempt even though in the course of his duties he spends substantial portions
of his time in such work as driving over fixed routes and calling on established
customers to pick up the commodities, delivering them to the company plant,
returning the empty containers and delivering payment checks, and other work
incidental to his occupation as an outside buyer. On the other hand, a routeman
who merely trucks commodities is not within the exemption.
20c02 - Performance of work not within the exemption.
For enforcement purpose, an outside buyer will be considered exempt even
though he spends 20% or less of his time in the w/w in nonexempt activities.
20c03 - "Promotional work" by an outside buyer of poultry. eggs, cream, or milk.
Promotional work with farmers, designed to increase the amount of poultry, eggs,
cream, or milk purchased in their raw or natural state by an outside buyer, is work
characteristic of the occupation or an individual employed as an outside buyer of
such products, and would not serve to defeat the exemption. Such promotional

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20c

work is different from work foreign to the occupation, as for example the picking
up of supplies bought by the employer, or the performance of productive work on
the products purchased (other than their incidental delivery to the employer when
purchased). These latter activities are not within the occupation of "outside
buyer", and will defeat the exemption.
20c04 - Outside buyer who also tests milk at plant.
The work of testing milk at the plant is not the work of an outside buyer within
the meaning of the Sec 13(b)(5) exemption.
20c05 - Employees of hatchery who "cull" poultry on farms.
An employee who is part of a crew employed by a hatchery to test poultry raised
by poultry farmers, for the purpose of eliminating diseased fowls, is not an
"outside buyer" within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(5), even though the hatchery
reimburses the poultry farmer for the loss of the culled fowls. These employees
are not primarily employed as buyers. Their primary purpose is to dispose of the
culled poultry so that the flock will not be adversely affected. This particular
activity, however, may be exempt under Sec 13(a)(6).
20c06 - "Outside buyer" may qualify as an administrative employee.
In some instances it may be found that an employee may be properly exempt
under Sec 13(a)(1), if he meets the test provided in Reg 541, particularly with
regard to an administrative employee.

20d

20d - EMPLOYMENT IN AGRICULTURE OR IRRIGATION - SEC 13(b)(12)
20d00 - General considerations.
Sec 13(b)(12) provides an OT exemption for the named operations. The principles
governing the application of the exemption are contained in IB 780.400 thru
780.409. The MW rate applicable to such employment is that of Sec 6(a)(5), i.e.,
$2.20 per hour until 1/1/78, and Sec 6(a)(1) thereafter, except for the irrigation
activities specifically described in the exemption which are performed off the
farm by nonfarmers. The latter are due the Sec 6(a)(1) MW rate. However, if the
irrigation work which meets requirement for exemption is employment in
agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f), the possible application of Sec
13(a)(6) should not be overlooked.

20f

20f - EMPLOYMENT BY SMALL COUNTRY ELEVATORS WITHIN AREA OF
PRODUCTION - FLSA SEC 13(b)(14)
20f00 - General provisions of the exemption.
(a) Sec 13(b)(14) exempts from the OT provisions of the FLSA "any employee
employed within the area of production (as defined by the Secretary) by an
establishment commonly recognized as a country elevator, including such an
establishment which sells products and services used in the operation of a farm, if
no more than five employees are employed in the establishment in such
operations".
(b) WH’s position with regard to this exemption is set forth in IB 780, Subpart H,
Sections .700-.724.
(c) The term "area of production" is defined in Reg 536.3. This definition applies to
Sec 13(b)(14) of the amended Act.
20f01 - Applying tests - area of production.
(a) Reg 536 defines "Area of Production". The Area of Production chart (FOH 20f02)
graphically represents a summary of the requirements in the definition.
(b) In determining whether 95% of the commodities come from the "normal rural
source of supply" during a particular month, only the commodities arriving at the
establishment that month are considered.
(c) Irrespective of segregation, employees who work only on commodities received
from within the specified distances are not exempt if the establishment itself does
not meet the distance-percentage tests for receipt of commodities.
(d) In applying the population tests of Reg 536, the 1980 U.S. decennial census of
population shall be used for all w/w’s.
(e) Where an establishment is engaged in performing operations on two or more
commodities, one for which a 20-mile distance is specified, and soybeans for
which the specified distance is 50 miles, the tolerance of 5% applies to the
combined receipts of the commodities. Thus, if more than 95% of the soybeans
are received from within the 50 miles, but less than 95% of the cream from within
20 miles, the distance test could be met if the dollar value of the receipts of both

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20f

commodities from disqualifying sources or distances does not exceed 5% of the
total receipts. (See Reg 536.3(b)(4).)
20f02 - Area of production chart.
Receipts which may be counted towards 95 percent: 1, 2, 3, 4.
Receipts which may not be counted towards 95 percent: X, Y, Z.
If more than 5 percent of the commodities come from X, Y, or Z, the exemption
does not apply.
AREA OUTSIDE DISTANCE SPECIFIED IN REG. PART 536

20f03 - Measuring distances - area of production.
(a) The Regs specify that the distances involved in the area of production definition
shall be airline distances. However, the extent to which a CO must go in making
an actual physical check of required distances will be governed by the needs of

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20f

the particular investigation. For normal investigation purposes, the distance
between required points may be based on a "rule of thumb" measurement; that is,
a roughly practical rather than a scientific measurement. On a comparatively
straight road the odometer reading on an automobile may be used, or the distance
may be determined by the scale of miles on a map.
(b) Measurements for distances shall be made from the nearest boundaries of the
premises on which the establishments in question are located, the nearest
boundaries of the farm or farms, and the nearest boundaries of the city, town, or
village to be considered. Where some portion of a particular farm lies outside the
specified distance, the entire farm shall be counted as if it were within the
specified distance.
(c) If any difficulty is experienced in measuring distances where an unincorporated
community is involved, the matter shall be referred to the AA for OFLS in order
that the "metes and bounds" of the community as used in the 1980 Census of
population may be secured from the Bureau of Census.

(a) Sec 13(b)(16) provides an OT exemption for "any employee engaged
(1) in the transportation and preparation for transportation of fruits or
vegetables, whether or not performed by the farmer, from the farm to a
place of first processing or first marketing within the same State, or
(2) in transportation, whether or not performed by the farmer, between the

employed in the harvesting of fruits or vegetables".
(b) The principles contained in IB 780.900 thru 780.923 explain the application of
this exemption.
20h01 - Sugar cane and sugar beets.
Sugar cane and sugar beets are neither "fruits" nor "vegetables" for purposes of
the Sec 13(b)(16) exemption (see IB 780.907). On the other hand, however, Secs
13(b)(26) and 13(h)(1)(D) relate specifically to sugar cane and sugar beets.

20j - SECS 7(m), 13(h), 13(i), and 13(j) - GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
20j00 - Enforcement policy for computing BW when the employer is subject to Sec
7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j) exemptions.
(a) When an employer has failed to pay OT specifically required by Sec 7(a) but
could have properly applied any of the above exemptions to the period when no
OT was paid, care must be taken in determining the extent of liability to assure
that he/she is not given an advantage in applying the exemption retroactively that
would not have been available to an employer who conscientiously applied the
exemption each week as he/she went along. For this reason, WH will be guided
by the following in enforcing the Act:
(1) If the employer has available during a particular investigation period year
any of the exemptions, but has failed to post the required notice of
exemption and has failed to keep the records as required in Reg 516,
Subpart B, it will be assumed that he has claimed as exempt weeks the
first 14 weeks in the year in which the establishment engaged in
operations subject to the exemption and in which the employer did not pay
OT compensation for hours over 40 in a week. If in any of these first 14
weeks of OT any employee has worked in excess of 10 hours a day or 48
hours in week, without receiving OT pay, BW shall be sought in these
weeks for the employee for hours in excess of 10 or 48 in those weeks.
Such weeks will be counted as weeks of exemption. Of course, when the
exempt weeks are used up, OT is due for hours worked in excess of 40 in
all remaining weeks in the calendar year. (See also FOH 32a01.)
(2) The calendar year (or period of 52 consecutive weeks) is used in
determining the weeks of exemption irrespective of the fact that some part
of a calendar year (or period) may fall outside a 2-year investigation
period. While the Statute of Limitations may preclude a request for BW
for more than a 2-year period of time, it has no application insofar as the
selection of the exempt w/w’s is concerned. Thus, if a 2-year investigation
period started in the latter part of the calendar year or period, it is possible
that all (or some) of the weeks of exemption for that year or period were
used up before the investigation period started, and no more weeks (or
fewer than the specified number of weeks) are available for the balance of
that year or period.
(b) The policy regarding BW contained in FOH 32a01(b) is also applicable to Secs
7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j).

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20j

20j01 - Selection of weeks.
(a) The choice of the fourteen weeks is a matter that is within the discretion of the
employer. Exemption may be taken, however, only for such w/w’s during which
the operations specified in the Act are carried on and only for those employees
who worked not more than 10 hours in a day or 48 hours in a week, or were
compensated at time and one half their regular rate of pay for hours worked in
excess of 10 a day or 48 a week.
(b) The exempt weeks need not run consecutively. The decision as to each w/w
during which the establishment operated under the exemptions may be made at
the end of the w/w, the employees being paid accordingly, the nature of the
exemption taken being recorded on the payroll, and a notice thereof being posted
in accordance with Reg 516.
20j02 - Application of exemption when same employer operates more than one
establishment.
The weeks taken under these exemptions are applicable on an establishment basis,
and an employee may be subject to an exemption in each establishment in which
he works, even though the establishments are operated by a single employer.
20j03 - Exempt w/w overlapping end of old and beginning of new year.
If the w/w overlaps the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, the
employer may charge the week against the quota under either year; that is, it may
be charged against the old year if he has unused exempt weeks remaining from
that year, but it must be charged against the new year’s quota if he has exhausted
exempt weeks in the old year.
20j04 - OT standard.
Since these are exemptions from Sec 7(a), neither can be operative with respect to
any employee in a w/w when he does not work hours in excess of those specified
in Sec 7(a). If an employer can qualify for one of these exemptions he need not
pay daily OT for hours in excess of 10 in a day when no Sec 7(a) weekly OT is
worked by the employee. If an employee works two 14-hour days in a particular
w/w (28 hours total for the w/w) no OT compensation is due as he has not
exceeded the 40-hour weekly OT standard. But if an employee engaged in exempt

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

operations worked three 14-hour days in a selected w/w (42 hours total for the
w/w), payment of OT compensation would be due for 12 hours.

7(m)
20t00 - Statutory provisions.
(a) Sec 7(m) provides a partial OT exemption: "for a period or periods of not more
than fourteen workweeks in the aggregate in any calendar year, any employer
may employ any employee for a workweek in excess of that specified in
subsection (a) without paying the compensation for overtime prescribed in such
subsection, if such employee (1) is employed by such employer a. to provide services (including stripping and grading) necessary and
incidental to the sale at auction of green leaf tobacco of type 11,
12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 35, 36, or 37 (as such types are
defined by the Secretary of Agriculture), or in auction sale, buying,
handling, stemming, redrying, packing, and storing of such
tobacco,
b. in auction sale, buying, handling, sorting, grading, packing, or
storing green leaf tobacco of type 32 (as such type is defined by
the Secretary of Agriculture), or
c. in auction sale, buying, handling, stripping, sorting, grading,
sizing, packing or stemming prior to packing, of perishable cigar
leaf tobacco of type 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 61, or
62, (as such types are defined by the Secretary of Agriculture); and
(2) receives for a. such employment by such employer which is in excess of ten hours
in any workday, or
b. such employment by such employer which is in excess of fortyeight hours in any workweek, compensation at a rate not less than
one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.
An employer who receives an exemption under this subsection shall not be
eligible for any other exemption under this section."

20t01 - Application of Sec 7(m).
(a) The weeks taken under the Sec 7(m) exemption are applicable on an
establishment basis, and an employee may be subject to the 14-week exemption in
each establishment he works, even though such establishments are operated by a
single employer.
(b) Sec 7(m) is available only to the types of employment named in the language of
the exemption.
(c) Sec 7(m) is applicable on a w/w basis. See FOH 20j00 and 32a01 regarding
computation of BW where its terms are not met. The employer may use the Sec
7(m) exemption for any of 14 w/w’s ending in the calendar year if the tests are
met. Pursuant to the last sentence of Sec 7(m), where an employer claims
exemption for an employee under this exemption he or she may not claim another
exemption from Sec 7 for such employee, such as under Sec 13(b)(12).

20u

20u - EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN PROVIDING SERVICES IN COTTON AND
SUGAR PROCESSING - SEC 13(h)
20u00 - Statutory provisions.
(a) This Sec provides a partial OT exemption (up to 10 hours in a workday and up to
48 hours in a w/w for up to 14 w/w’s in the aggregate in any calendar year) for
employees employed "exclusively to provide services necessary and incidental
to":
"(A) . . . the ginning of cotton in an establishment primarily engaged in the
ginning of cotton;" or
“(B) . . . the receiving, handling, and storing of raw cotton and the compressing of
raw cotton when performed at a cotton warehouse or compress-warehouse
facility, other than one operated in conjunction with a cotton mill, primarily
engaged in storing and compressing;" or
"(C) . . . the receiving, handling, storing, and processing of cottonseed in an
establishment primarily engaged in the receiving, handling, storing, and
processing of cottonseed; or"
"(D) . . . the processing of sugar cane or sugar beets in an establishment primarily
engaged in the processing of sugar cane or sugar beets . . . ."
(b)
(1) An employer’s use of the Sec 13(h) exemption for a particular group of
employees precludes use of any other exemption under Secs 7 or 13 for
those employees. Such use, however, does not prohibit utilizing Secs 13(i)
or 13(j) for certain other employees simply because Sec 13(h) is used.
Thus, for example, if an employer claims Sec 13(h) for certain employees
in the establishment, he or she cannot claim other Sec 7 or Sec 13
exemptions for them, but can utilize Secs 13(a)(1), 13(i), or 13(j) for nonSec 13(h) activities by other employees.
(2) The statutory wording "necessary and incidental" in Sec 13(h) is not
analogous in scope to that of "engaged in" in Secs 13(i) and 13(j) and shall
not be interpreted to have the same meaning and effect. For example,
employers whose employees actually perform the operations described in
Sec 13(i) or 13(j) may claim the exemption for those so engaged.
Employers whose employees are engaged in occupations "necessary and

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20u

incidental" to work performed pursuant to Sec 13(i) or 13(j), who work
exclusively in such operations and who work solely in those portions of
the premises devoted by their employer to such operations, may claim
exemption(s) provided by Sec 13(h).
(3) Sec 13(h) is more narrow in its application than the expired Secs 7(c) and
7(d) with respect to the cotton storing and compressing and cottonseed
processing industries. Pursuant to Reg 526.10(b)(8) and 526.11(b)(1), old
Secs 7(c) and 7(d) exempted entire industries, whereas Secs 13(h)(1)(B)
and 13(h)(1)(C) exempt only individual employees. Sec 13(h) requires that
employees be "exclusively" involved in specified activities (thus
permitting no tolerances).
(c) Sec 13(h) provides an exemption for employees performing auxiliary services
(services that are "necessary and incidental" to the named operations) which are
not exempt under Secs 13(i) and 13(j). It also replaces Secs 7(c) and/or (d) with
respect to the operations named in Sec 13(h) which were previously exempted
under Secs 7(c) and/or 7(d). For example employees not actually engaged in
ginning cotton (see IB 780.810) or processing sugar beets, sugar beet molasses, or
sugar cane into sugar (see IB 780.818) may be eligible for the exemption provided
by this Sec.
20u01 - Cottonseed processing.
(a) Pursuant to Sec 13(h) the term "processing of cottonseed" includes cleaning and
removing hulls and linters from cottonseed, extracting oil therefrom, making
cottonseed cake and, when done in a continuous series of operations with the
crushing, grinding cake into meal.
(b) The following processing operations are included during the period when the seed
is being received:
(1) The grinding of cottonseed cake, even when not part of a continuous series
of operations with the crushing, and even though an insubstantial amount
of hull bran purchased from other sources is added. Handling and grinding
of the purchased bran when only an insubstantial amount is added, are
included in the exemption.
(2) The processing of hulls into fiber and bran. The exemption is not
applicable to the further processing into fiber and bran of hulls which have

Rev. 583 – 7/6/90

FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

20u

been received from other cottonseed crushing mills, except where the
amount of such hulls is insubstantial.
(3) The manufacture of pellets from cottonseed meal and hulls (same
exception as noted in (2) above).
(4) The refining of crude cottonseed oil, which has been produced exclusively
at the crushing mill, only when done in a continuous series of operations
with the crushing. The exemption extends to laboratory employees testing
crude or refined oil during the crushing season.
(c) Processing cottonseed includes preparation of cottonseed for planting by means of
drying, screening, delinting, redrying, or poisoning.
(d) As a practical matter, CO’s are not expected to check for trivial amounts of time
spent by an otherwise exempt employee in nonexempt work such as selling
bagging and ties as an accommodation.
20u02 - Cotton storing and compressing within the meaning of Sec 13(h).
Includes the receiving, handling, and storing of raw cotton and the compressing of
raw cotton when performed at a cotton warehouse or compress-warehouse facility
other than one operated in conjunction with a cotton mill. Also included are any
operations incident to the foregoing such as loading, unloading, weighing,
sampling, assembling, and preparing for shipment, when performed at the storing
establishment.

20v - EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN COTTON GINNING - SEC 13(i)
20v00 - Statutory provisions.
(a) Sec 13(i) provides a partial OT exemption "for a period or periods of not more
than fourteen workweeks in the aggregate in any period of fifty-two consecutive
weeks to any employee who –
(1) is engaged in the ginning of cotton for market in any place of employment
located in a county where cotton is grown in commercial quantities, and
(2) receives for any such employment during such workweeks –
a. in excess of ten hours in any workday, and
b. in excess of forty-eight hours in any workweek, and compensation
at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at
which he is employed. No week included in any fifty-two week
period for purposes of the preceding sentence may be included for
such purposes in any other fifty-two week period".
(b) Unlike Sec 7(c) (repealed effective 12/31/76) that applied on a calendar-year
basis, Sec 13(i), like former Sec 13(b)(25), is applicable during the active season
within a period of 52 consecutive weeks. This means an employer may start his or
her exemption year in any w/w during the active season and can select the Sec
13(i) exemption weeks available from the rest of the subsequent 51 w/w’s.
(c) Prior to the 1977 amendments (effective 1/1/78), Sec 13(i) replaced Sec 13(b)(25)
and the latter provided a partial OT exemption as illustrated in the following
table:
Hours of work permitted during each such

20v01 - Cotton ginning.
Includes the following operations, when performed during the period or periods
when cotton is being received for ginning: the receiving of seed cotton at the gin,
the handling, cleaning, ginning, and baling of the cotton, the handling of the baled
cotton and cottonseed, and any operations or services necessary or incident to the
foregoing, including the placing of the cotton and cottonseed in storage or
transportation facilities on or near the premises.
20v02 - Active vs. dead season.
The exemption does not include operations which are performed during periods
when the establishment is not receiving cotton for ginning, that is, during the dead
season. Thus, the employees engaged in performing repair work at the gin during
the dead season are not exempt under Sec 13(i).
20v03 - Principles in IB 780.
The principles in IB 780.800 thru .814 are applicable for purposes of Sec 13(i).

cane into sugar (other than refined sugar) or syrup; and

b. in excess of forty-eight hours in any workweek, compensation at a
rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which
he is employed. No week included in any fifty-two week period for

purposes in any other fifty-two week period."
(b) Unlike expired Secs 7(c) and 7(d) (repealed 12/31/76) that applied on a calendaryear basis, Sec 13(j), like former Sec 13(b)(26), is applicable during the active

the Sec 13(j) exemption weeks available from the rest of the subsequent 51 w/w’s.
(c) Prior to the 1977 amendments (effective 1/1/78), Sec 13(j) replaced 13(b)(26) and
