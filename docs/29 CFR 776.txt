§776.0 Subpart limited to individual employee coverage.
This subpart, which was adopted before the amendments of 1961 and 1966 to the Fair Labor Standards Act, is
limited to discussion of general coverage of the Act on the traditional basis of engagement by individual employees
“in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce”. The 1961 and 1966 amendments broadened coverage
by extending it to other employees on an “enterprise” basis, when “employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce
or in the production of goods for commerce” as defined in section 3 (r), (s), of the present Act. Employees covered
under the principles discussed in this subpart remain covered under the Act as amended; however, an employee who
would not be individually covered under the principles discussed in this subpart may now be subject to the Act if he
is employed in a covered enterprise as defined in the amendments. Questions of “enterprise coverage” not answered
in published statements of the Department of Labor may be addressed to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour
Division, Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210 or assistance may be requested from any of the Regional or
District Offices of the Division.

INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE COVERAGE
§776.0a Introductory statement.
(a) Scope and significance of this part. (1) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 19381 (hereinafter referred to as
the Act), brings within the general coverage of its wage and hours provisions every employee who is “engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.”2 What employees are so engaged must be ascertained in the
light of the definitions of “commerce”, “goods”, and “produced” which are set forth in the Act as amended by the
Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949,3 giving due regard to authoritative interpretations by the courts and to
the legislative history of the Act, as amended. Interpretations of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division
with respect to this general coverage are set forth in this part to provide “a practical guide to employers and
employees as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it.”4 These
interpretations with respect to the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions of the Act, indicate the
construction of the law which the Administrator believes to be correct and which will guide him in the performance
of his administrative duties under the Act unless and until he is otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the
courts or concludes, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it is incorrect.

Pub. L. 718, 75th Cong., 3d sess. (52 Stat. 1060), as amended by the Act of June 26, 1940 (Pub. Res. No. 88, 76th Cong.,
3d sess., 54 Stat. 616); by Reorganization Plan No. 2 (60 Stat. 1095), effective July 16, 1946; by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,
approved May 14, 1947 (61 Stat. 84); and by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, approved October 26, 1949 (Pub.
L. 393, 81st Cong., 1st sess., 63 Stat. 910); by Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1950 (15 FR 3174), effective May 24, 1950; and by
the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1955, approved August 12, 1955 (Pub. L. 381, 84th Cong., 1st sess., C. 867, 69 Stat.
711).

The requirement of section 6 as to minimum wages is: “Every employer shall pay to each of his employees who is
engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce wages at the following rates—” (not less than $1.00 an hour,
except in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to which special provisions apply).

The requirement of section 7 as to maximum hours which an employee may work without receiving extra pay for overtime
is: “no employer shall employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce for
a workweek longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours
above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”

Pub. L. 393, 81st Cong., 1st sess. (63 Stat. 910). These amendments, effective January 25, 1950, leave the existing law
unchanged except as to provisions specifically amended and the addition of certain new provisions. Section 3(b) of the Act,
defining “commerce”, and section 3(j), defining “produced”, were specifically amended as explained in §§776.13 and 776.17(a)
herein.

(2) Under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,5 interpretations of the Administrator may, under certain
circumstances, be controlling in determining the rights and liabilities of employers and employees. The
interpretations contained in this bulletin are interpretations on which reliance may be placed as provided in section
10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, so long as they remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded, or
determined by judicial authority to be incorrect. However, the omission to discuss a particular problem in this part or
in interpretations supplementing it should not be taken to indicate the adoption of any position by the Administrator
with respect to such problem or to constitute an administrative interpretation or practice or enforcement policy.

Pub. L. 49, 80th Cong., 1st sess. (61 Stat. 84), discussed in part 790 of this chapter.

(b) Exemptions and child labor provisions not discussed. This part does not deal with the various specific
exemptions provided in the statute, under which certain employees engaged in commerce or in the production of
goods for commerce and thus within the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions are wholly or partially
excluded from the protection of the Act's minimum-wage and overtime-pay requirements. Some of these exemptions
are self-executing; others call for definitions or other action by the Administrator. Regulations and interpretations
relating to specific exemptions may be found in other parts of this chapter. Coverage and exemptions under the child
labor provisions of the Act are discussed in a separate interpretative bulletin (§§570.101 to 570.121 of this chapter)
issued by the Secretary of Labor.
(c) Earlier interpretations superseded. All general and specific interpretations issued prior to July 11, 1947,
with respect to the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions of the Act were rescinded and withdrawn by
§776.0(b) of the general statement on this subject, published in the FEDERAL REGISTER on that date as part 776 of
this chapter (12 FR 4583). To the extent that interpretations contained in such general statement or in releases,
opinion letters, and other statements issued on or after July 11, 1947, are inconsistent with the provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, they do not continue in effect after January 24, 1950.6 Effective on the date
of its publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER, subpart A of this interpretative bulletin replaces and supersedes the
general statement previously published as part 776 of this chapter, which statement is withdrawn. All other
administrative rulings, interpretations, practices and enforcement policies relating to the general coverage of the
wages and hours provisions of the Act and not withdrawn prior to such date are, to the extent that they are
inconsistent with or in conflict with the principles stated in this interpretative bulletin, hereby rescinded and
withdrawn.

Section 16(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 910) provides:

“Any order, regulation, or interpretation of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division or of the Secretary of Labor,
and any agreement entered into by the Administrator or the Secretary, in effect under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, as amended, on the effective date of this Act, shall remain in effect as an order, regulation, interpretation, or
agreement of the Administrator or the Secretary, as the case may be, pursuant to this Act, except to the extent that any such order,
regulation, interpretation, or agreement may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, or may from time to time be
amended, modified, or rescinded by the Administrator or the Secretary, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of
this Act.”

HOW COVERAGE IS DETERMINED
§776.1 General interpretative guides.

The congressional policy under which employees “engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for
commerce” are brought within the general coverage of the Act's wage and hours provisions is stated in section 2 of
the Act. This section makes it clear that the congressional power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is
exercised in this Act in order to remedy certain evils, namely, “labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of
the minimum standards of living necessary for health, efficiency, and the general well being of workers” which
Congress found “(a) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to perpetuate
such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (b) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in
commerce; (c) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (d) leads to labor disputes burdening and
obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce and (e) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing
of goods in commerce.” In carrying out these broad remedial purposes, however, the Congress did not choose to
make the scope of the Act coextensive in all respects with the limits of its power over commerce or to apply it to all
activities affecting commerce.7 Congress delimited the area in which the Act operates by providing for certain
exceptions and exemptions, and by making wage-hour coverage applicable only to employees who are “engaged in”
either “commerce”, as defined in the Act, or “production” of “goods” for such commerce, within the meaning of the
Act's definitions of these terms. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949 indicate an intention to restrict
somewhat the category of employees within the reach of the Act under the former definition of “produced” and to
expand to some extent the group covered under the former definition of “commerce.” In his interpretations, the
Administrator will endeavor to give effect to both the broad remedial purposes of the Act and the limitations on its
application, seeking guidance in his task from the terms of the statute, from authoritative court decisions, and from
the legislative history of the Act, as amended.8

time this part was prepared.

§776.2 Employee basis of coverage.
(a) The coverage of the Act's wage and hours provisions as described in sections 6 and 7 does not deal in a
blanket way with industries as a whole. Thus, in section 6, it is provided that every employer shall pay the statutory
minimum wage to “each of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for
commerce.” It thus becomes primarily an individual matter as to the nature of the employment of the particular
employee. Some employers in a given industry may have no employees covered by the Act; other employers in the
industry may have some employees covered by the Act, and not others; still other employers in the industry may
have all their employees within the Act's coverage. If, after considering all relevant factors, employees are found to
be engaged in covered work, their employer cannot avoid his obligations to them under the Act on the ground that
he is not “engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.” To the extent that his employees are
so engaged, he is himself so engaged.9

319 U.S. 491; Mabee v. White Plains Pub. Co., 327 U.S. 178.

(b) In determining whether an individual employee is within the coverage of the wage and hours provisions,
however, the relationship of an employer's business to commerce or to the production of goods for commerce may
sometimes be an important indication of the character of the employee's work.10 It is apparent, too, from the 1949
amendment to the definition of “produced” and its legislative history that an examination of the character of the

employer's business will in some borderline situations be necessary in determining whether the employees'
occupation bears the requisite close relationship to production for commerce.11

§776.3 Persons engaging in both covered and noncovered activities.
The Act applies to employees “engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce” without
regard to whether such employees, or their employer, are also engaged in other activities which would not bring
them within the coverage of the Act. The Act makes no distinction as to the percentage, volume, or amount of
activities of either employee or employer which constitute engaging in commerce or in the production of goods for
commerce. Sections 6 and 7 refer to “each” and “any” employee so engaged, and section 15(a)(1) prohibits the
introduction into the channels of interstate or foreign commerce of “any” goods in the production of which “any”
employee was employed in violation of section 6 or section 7. Although employees doing work in connection with
mere isolated, sporadic, or occasional shipments in commerce of insubstantial amounts of goods will not be
considered covered by virtue of that fact alone, the law is settled that every employee whose engagement in
activities in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, even though small in amount, is regular and
recurring, is covered by the Act.12 This does not, however, necessarily mean that an employee who at some particular
time may engage in work which brings him within the coverage of the Act is, by reason of that fact, thereafter
indefinitely entitled to its benefits.

§776.4 Workweek standard.
(a) The workweek is to be taken as the standard in determining the applicability of the Act.13 Thus, if in any
workweek an employee is engaged in both covered and noncovered work he is entitled to both the wage and hours
benefits of the Act for all the time worked in that week, unless exempted therefrom by some specific provision of
the Act. The proportion of his time spent by the employee in each type of work is not material. If he spends any part
of the workweek in covered work he will be considered on exactly the same basis as if he had engaged exclusively
in such work for the entire period. Accordingly, the total number of hours which he works during the workweek at
both types of work must be compensated for in accordance with the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions of
the Act.
13
See Gordon's Transports v. Walling, 162 F. 2d 203 (C.A. 6), certiorari denied 332 U.S. 774; Walling v. Fox-Pelletier
Detective Agency, 4 W.H. Cases 452 (W.D. Tenn.), 8 Labor Cases 62,219; Walling v. Black Diamond Coal Mining Co., 59 F.
Supp. 348 (W.D. Ky.); Fleming v. Knox, 42 F. Supp. 948 (S.D. Ga.); Roberg v. Henry Phipps Estate, 156 F. 2d 958 (C.A. 2). For
a definition of the workweek, see §778.2(c) of this chapter.

(b) It is thus recognized that an employee may be subject to the Act in one workweek and not in the next. It is
likewise true that some employees of an employer may be subject to the Act and others not. But the burden of
effecting segregation between covered and noncovered work as between particular workweeks for a given employee
or as between different groups of employees is upon the employer. Where covered work is being regularly or
recurrently performed by his employees, and the employer seeks to segregate such work and thereby relieve himself
of his obligations under sections 6 and 7 with respect to particular employees in particular workweeks, he should be
prepared to show, and to demonstrate from his records, that such employees in those workweeks did not engage in
any activities in interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce, which would
necessarily include a showing that such employees did not handle or work on goods or materials shipped in
commerce or used in production of goods for commerce, or engage in any other work closely related and directly

essential to production of goods for commerce.14 The Division's experience has indicated that much so-called
“segregation” does not satisfy these tests and that many so-called “segregated” employees are in fact engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.
See Guess v. Montague, 140 F. 2d 500 (C.A. 4).

14

§776.5 Coverage not dependent on method of compensation.
The Act's individual employee coverage is not limited to employees working on an hourly wage. The
requirements of section 6 as to minimum wages are that “each” employee described therein shall be paid wages at a
rate not less than a specified rate “an hour”.15 This does not mean that employees cannot be paid on a piecework
basis or on a salary, commission, or other basis; it merely means that whatever the basis on which the workers are
paid, whether it be monthly, weekly, or on a piecework basis, they must receive at least the equivalent of the
minimum hourly rate. “Each” and “any” employee obviously and necessarily includes one compensated by a unit of
time, by the piece, or by any other measurement.16 Regulations prescribed by the Administrator (part 516 of this
chapter) provide for the keeping of records in such form as to enable compensation on a piecework or other basis to
be translated into an hourly rate.17
Special exceptions are made for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

and 778 of this chapter.

§776.6 Coverage not dependent on place of work.
Except for the general geographical limitations discussed in §776.7, the Act contains no prescription as to the
place where the employee must work in order to come within its coverage. It follows that employees otherwise
coming within the terms of the Act are entitled to its benefits whether they perform their work at home, in the
factory, or elsewhere.18 The specific provisions of the Act relative to regulation of homework serve to emphasize this
fact.19

Homeworkers' Handicraft Cooperative, 176 F. 2d 633 (C.A. 4).

See 6(a)(2); Sec. 11(d).

19

§776.7 Geographical scope of coverage.
(a) The geographical areas within which the employees are to be deemed “engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce” within the meaning of the Act, and thus within its coverage are governed by
definitions in section 3 (b), (c), and (j). In the definition of “produced” in section 3(j), “production” is expressly
confined to described employments “in any State.” (See §776.15 (a).) “Commerce” is defined to mean described
activities “among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.” (See §776.8.) “State” is
defined in section 3(c) to mean “any State of the United States or the District of Columbia or any Territory or
possession of the United States.”
(b) Under the definitions in paragraph (a) of this section, employees within the District of Columbia; Puerto
Rico; the Virgin Islands; Outer Continental Shelf lands defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (ch. 345,
67 Stat. 462, 43 U.S.C. 1331); American Samoa; Guam; Wake Island; Enewetok Atoll; Kwajalein Atoll; Johnston
Island; and the Canal Zone are dealt with on the same basis as employees working in any of the 50 States.20 Congress

did not exercise the national legislative power over the District of Columbia or the Territories or possessions
referred to by extending the Act to purely local commerce within them.
20
An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 71 Stat. 514 (approved Aug. 30, 1957) provides that no
employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the Act with respect to work performed at any time in work places
excluded from the Act's coverage by this law or for work performed prior to Nov. 29, 1957, on Guam, Wake Island, or the Canal
Zone; or for work performed prior to the establishment, by the Secretary, of a minimum wage rate applicable to such work in
American Samoa. Work performed by employees in “a work place within a foreign country or within territory under the
jurisdiction of the United States” other than those enumerated in this paragraph is exempt by this amendment from coverage
under the Act. When part of the work performed by an employee for an employer in any workweek is covered work performed in
any State, it makes no difference where the remainder of such work is performed; the employee is entitled to the benefits of the
Act for the entire workweek unless he comes within some specific exemption. The reference in 71 Stat. 514 to liability for work
performed in American Samoa is an extension of the relief granted by the American Samoa Labor Standards Amendments of
1956 (29 U.S.C. Supp. IV, secs. 206, 213, and 216).

[15 FR 2925, May 17, 1950, as amended at 35 FR 5543, Apr. 3, 1970]

ENGAGING “IN COMMERCE”
§776.8 The statutory provisions.
(a) The activities constituting “commerce” within the meaning of the phrase “engaged in commerce” in
sections 6 and 7 of the Act are defined in section 3(b) as follows:
Commerce means trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States, or between
any State and any place outside thereof.21
21

As amended by section 3(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949.

As has been noted in §776.7, the word “State” in this definition refers not only to any of the fifty States but also to
the District of Columbia and to any Territory or possession of the United States.
(b) It should be observed that the term commerce is very broadly defined. The definition does not limit the
term to transportation, or to the “commercial” transactions involved in “trade,” although these are expressly
included. Neither is the term confined to commerce in “goods.” Obviously, “transportation” or “commerce” between
any State and any place outside its boundaries includes a movement of persons as well as a movement of goods. And
“transmission” or “communication” across State lines constitutes “commerce” under the definition, without
reference to whether anything so transmitted or communicated is “goods.”22
“Goods” is, however, broadly defined in the Act. See §776.20(a).

22

The inclusion of the term “commerce” in the definition of the same term as used in the Act implies that no special or
limited meaning is intended; rather, that the scope of the term for purposes of the Act is at least as broad as it would
be under concepts of “commerce” established without reference to this definition.
§776.9 General scope of “in commerce” coverage.
Under the definitions quoted above, it is clear that the employees who are covered by the wage and hours
provisions of the Act as employees “engaged in commerce” are employees doing work involving or related to the
movement of persons or things (whether tangibles or intangibles, and including information and intelligence)
“among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.”23 Although this does not include
employees engaged in activities which merely “affect” such interstate or foreign commerce, the courts have made it
clear that coverage of the Act based on engaging in commerce extends to every employee employed “in the channels
of” such commerce or in activities so closely related to such commerce, as a practical matter, that they should be
considered a part of it.24 The courts have indicated that the words “in commerce” should not be so limited by

construction as to defeat the purpose of Congress, but should be interpreted in a manner consistent with their
practical meaning and effect in the particular situation. One practical question to be asked is whether, without the
particular service, interstate or foreign commerce would be impeded, impaired, or abated;25 others are whether the
service contributes materially to the consummation of transactions in interstate or foreign commerce26 or makes it
possible for existing instrumentalities of commerce27 to accomplish the movement of such commerce effectively and
to free it from burdens or obstructions.28
23
“Any place outside thereof” is not limited in meaning to another State or country. Any movement between a State and a
place “outside thereof” is “commerce” for purposes of the Act, such as ship-to-shore communication, or transportation out of a
State by ship of food, fuel, or ice to be consumed at sea before arrival at another port.

(a) Under the principles stated in §776.9, the wage and hours provisions of the Act apply typically, but not
exclusively, to employees such, as those in the telephone,29 telegraph,30 television, radio,31 transportation and
shipping32 industries, since these industries serve as the actual instrumentalities and channels of interstate and foreign
commerce. Similarly, employees of such businesses as banking, insurance, newspaper publishing,33 and others which
regularly utilize the channels of interstate and foreign commerce in the course of their operations, are generally
covered by the Act.

(b) Employees whose work is an essential part of the stream of interstate or foreign commerce, in whatever
type of business they are employed, are likewise engaged in commerce and within the Act's coverage. This would
include, for example, employees of a warehouse whose activities are connected with the receipt or distribution of

goods across State lines.34 Also, since “commerce” as used in the Act includes not only “transmission” of
communications but “communication” itself, employees whose work involves the continued use of the interstate
mails, telegraph, telephone or similar instrumentalities for communication across State lines are covered by the
Act.35 This does not mean that any use by an employee of the mails and other channels of communication is
sufficient to establish coverage. But if the employee, as a regular and recurrent part of his duties, uses such
instrumentalities in obtaining or communicating information or in sending or receiving written reports or messages,
or orders for goods or services, or plans or other documents across State lines, he comes within the scope of the Act
as an employee directly engaged in the work of “communication” between the State and places outside the State.

§776.11 Employees doing work related to instrumentalities of commerce.
(a) Another large category of employees covered as “engaged in commerce” is comprised of employees
performing the work involved in the maintenance, repair, or improvement of existing instrumentalities of commerce.
(See the cases cited in footnote 28 to §776.9. See also the discussion of coverage of employees engaged in building
and construction work, in subpart B of this part.) Typical illustrations of instrumentalities of commerce include
railroads, highways, city streets, pipe lines, telephone lines, electrical transmission lines, rivers, streams, or other
waterways over which interstate or foreign commerce more or less regularly moves; airports; railroad, bus, truck, or
steamship terminals; telephone exchanges, radio and television stations, post offices and express offices; bridges and
ferries carrying traffic moving in interstate or foreign commerce (even though within a single State); bays, harbors,
piers, wharves and docks used for shipping between a State and points outside; dams, dikes, revetments and levees
which directly facilitate the uninterrupted movement of commerce by enhancing or improving the usefulness of
waterways, railways, and highways through control of water depth, channels or flow in streams or through control of
flood waters; warehouses or distribution depots devoted to the receipt and shipment of goods in interstate or foreign
commerce; ships, vehicles, and aircraft regularly used in transportation of persons or goods in commerce; and
similar fixed or movable facilities on which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce depends.
(b) It is well settled that the work of employees involved in the maintenance, repair, or improvement of such
existing instrumentalities of commerce is so closely related to interstate or foreign commerce as to be in practice and
in legal contemplation a part of it. Included among the employees who are thus “engaged in commerce” within the
meaning of the Act are employees of railroads, telephone companies, and similar instrumentalities who are engaged
in maintenance-of-way work;36 employees (including office workers, guards, watchmen, etc.) engaged in work on
contracts or projects for the maintenance, repair, reconstruction or other improvement of such instrumentalities of
commerce as the transportation facilities of interstate railroads, highways, waterways, or other interstate
transportation facilities, or interstate telegraph, telephone, or electrical transmission facilities (see subpart B of this
part); and employees engaged in the maintenance or alteration and repair of ships37 or trucks38 used as
instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce. Also, employees have been held covered as engaged in
commerce where they perform such work as watching or guarding ships or vehicles which are regularly used in
commerce39 or maintaining, watching, or guarding warehouses, railroad or equipment yards, etc., where goods
moving in interstate commerce are temporarily held,40 or acting as porters, janitors, or in other maintenance
capacities in bus stations, railroad stations, airports, or other transportation terminals.41

Jacksonville Terminal Co., 315 U.S. 386.

(c) On the other hand, work which is less immediately related to the functioning of instrumentalities of
commerce than is the case in the foregoing examples may be too remote from interstate or foreign commerce to
establish coverage on the ground that the employee performing it is “engaged in commerce.” This has been held
true, for example, of a cook preparing meals for workmen who are repairing tracks over which interstate trains
operate,42 and of a porter caring for washrooms and lockers in a garage which is not an instrumentality of commerce,
where trucks used both in intrastate and interstate commerce are serviced.43

serviced was from 10 to 25 percent of total use).

(d) There are other situations in which employees are engaged “in commerce” and therefore within the
coverage of the Act because they contribute directly to the movement of commerce by providing goods or facilities
to be used or consumed by instrumentalities of commerce in the direct furtherance of their activities of
transportation, communication, transmission, or other movement in interstate or foreign commerce. Thus, for
example, employees are considered engaged “in commerce” where they provide to railroads, radio stations, airports,
telephone exchanges, or other similar instrumentalities of commerce such things as electric energy,44 steam, fuel, or
water, which are required for the movement of the commerce carried by such instrumentalities.45 Such work is “so
related to the actual movement of commerce as to be considered an essential and indispensable part thereof, and
without which it would be impeded or impaired.”46

§776.12 Employees traveling across State lines.
Questions are frequently asked as to whether the fact that an employee crosses State lines in connection with
his employment brings him within the Act's coverage as an employee “engaged in commerce.” Typical of the
employments in which such questions arise are those of traveling service men, traveling buyers, traveling
construction crews, collectors, and employees of such organizations as circuses, carnivals, road shows, and

orchestras. The area of coverage in such situations cannot be delimited by any exact formula, since questions of
degree are necessarily involved. If the employee transports material or equipment or other persons across State lines
or within a particular State as a part of an interstate movement, it is clear of course, that he is engaging in
commerce.47 And as a general rule, employees who are regularly engaged in traveling across State lines in the
performance of their duties (as distinguished from merely going to and from their homes or lodgings in commuting
to a work place) are engaged in commerce and covered by the Act.48 On the other hand, it is equally plain that an
employee who, in isolated or sporadic instances, happens to cross a State line in the course of his employment,
which is otherwise intrastate in character, is not, for that sole reason, covered by the Act. Nor would a man who
occasionally moves to another State in order to pursue an essentially local trade or occupation there become an
employee “engaged in commerce” by virtue of that fact alone. Doubtful questions arising in the area between the
two extremes must be resolved on the basis of the facts in each individual case.
47
The employee may, however, be exempt from the overtime provisions of the Act under section 13(b)(1). See part 792 of
this chapter.

48

S.D.).

§776.13 Commerce crossing international boundaries.
Under the Act, as amended, an employee engaged in “trade commerce, transportation, transmission, or
communication” between any State and any place outside thereof is covered by the Act regardless of whether the
“place outside” is another State or is a foreign country or is some other place. Before the amendment to section 3(b)
which became effective January 25, 1950, employees whose work related solely to the flow of commerce into a
State from places outside it which were not “States” as defined in the Act were not employees engaged in
“commerce” for purposes of the Act, although employees whose work was concerned with the flow of commerce
out of the State to such places were so engaged.49 This placed employees of importers in a less favorable position
under the Act than the employees of exporters. This inequality was removed by the amendment to section 3(b).50
Accordingly, employees performing work in connection with the importation of goods from foreign countries are
engaged “in commerce” and covered by the Act, as amended. The coverage of such employees, as of those
performing work in connection with the exportation of goods to foreign countries, is determined by the same
principles as in the case of employees whose work is connected with goods procured from or sent to other States.
49
The definition of “commerce” previously referred to commerce “from any State to any place outside thereof.” The
amendment substituted “between” for “from” and “and” for “to” in this clause.

ENGAGING IN “THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS FOR COMMERCE”
§776.14 Elements of “production” coverage.
Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, as has been noted, cover not only employees who are engaged “in commerce” as
explained above, but also “each” and “any” employee who is engaged in the “production” of “goods” for
“commerce”. What employees are so engaged can be determined only by references to the very comprehensive
definitions which Congress has supplied to make clear what is meant by “production”, by “goods,” and by
“commerce” as those words are used in sections 6 and 7. In the light of these definitions, there are three interrelated
elements of coverage to be considered in determining whether an employee is engaged in the production of goods
for commerce: (a) There must be “production”; (b) such production must be of “goods”; (c) such production of
goods must be “for commerce”; all within the meaning of the Act.51 The three elements of “production” coverage are
discussed in order in the sections following.
51
These elements need not be considered if the employee would be covered in any event because engaged “in commerce”
under the principles discussed in preceding sections of this part.

§776.15 “Production.”
(a) The statutory provisions. The activities constituting “production” within the meaning of the phrase
“engaged in * * * production of goods for commerce” are defined in the Act52 as follows:
Act, section 3(j). This definition is also applicable in determining coverage of the child labor provisions of the Act. See
part 4 of this title.
52

Produced means produced, manufactured, mined, handled, or in any other manner worked on in any State; and for the
purposes of this Act an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was
employed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any
closely related process or occupation directly essential to the production thereof, in any State.

The Act bars from interstate commerce “any” goods in the production of which “any” employee was employed in
violation of the minimum-wage or overtime-pay provisions,53 and provides that in determining, for purposes of this
provision, whether an employee was employed in the production of such goods:
53
Act, section 15(a)(1). The only exceptions are stated in the section itself, which provides that “it shall be unlawful for any
person—(1) to transport, offer for transportation, ship, deliver, or sell in commerce, or to ship, deliver, or sell with knowledge
that shipment or delivery or sale thereof in commerce is intended, any goods in the production of which any employee was
employed in violation of section 6 or section 7, or in violation of any regulation or order of the Administrator issued under
section 14; except that no provision of this Act shall impose any liability upon any common carrier for the transportation in
commerce in the regular course of its business of any goods not produced by such common carrier, and no provision of this Act
shall excuse any common carrier from its obligation to accept any goods for transportation; and except that any such
transportation, offer, shipment, delivery, or sale of such goods by a purchaser who acquired them in good faith in reliance on
written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance with the requirements of the Act, and who
acquired such goods for value without notice of any such violation, shall not be deemed unlawful;”

* * * proof that any employee was employed in any place of employment where goods shipped or sold in commerce were
produced, within ninety days prior to the removal of the goods from such place of employment, shall be prima facie evidence that
such employee was engaged in the production of such goods.54
54

Act, sec. 15(b).

(b) General scope of “production” coverage. The statutory provisions quoted in paragraph (a) of this section,
show that for purposes of the Act, wherever goods are being produced for interstate or foreign commerce, the
employees who are covered as “engaged in the production” of such goods, include, in general, all those whose work
may fairly be said to be a part of their employer's production of such goods,55 and include those whose work is
closely related and directly essential thereto,56 whether employed by the same or a different employee. (See §§776.17
to 776.19.) Typically, but not exclusively, this includes that large group of employees engaged in mines, oil fields,
quarries, and manufacturing, processing, or distributing plants where goods are produced for commerce. The
employees covered as engaged in “production” are not limited, however, to those engaged in actual physical work
on the product itself or to those in the factories, mines, warehouses, or other place of employment where goods
intended for commerce are being produced. If the requisite relationship to production of such goods is present, an
employee is covered, regardless of whether his work brings him into actual contact with such goods or into the
establishments where they are produced, and even though his employer may be someone other than the producer of
the goods for commerce.57 As explained more fully in the sections following, the Act's “production” coverage
embraces many employees who serve productive enterprises in capacities which do not involve working directly on
goods produced but which are nevertheless closely related and directly essential to successful operations in
producing goods for interstate or foreign commerce. And as a general rule, in conformity with the provisions of the
Act quoted in paragraph (a) of this section, an employee will be considered to be within the general coverage of the
wage and hours provisions if he is working in a place of employment where goods sold or shipped in interstate
commerce or foreign commerce are being produced, unless the employer maintains the burden of establishing that
the employee's functions are so definitely segregated from such production that they should not be regarded as
closely related and directly essential thereto.58

§776.16 Employment in “producing, * * * or in any other manner working on” goods.
(a) Coverage in general. Employees employed in “producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, or in any
other manner working on” goods (as defined in the Act, including parts or ingredients thereof) for interstate or
foreign commerce are considered actually engaged in the “production” of such goods, within the meaning of the
Act. Such employees have been within the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions since enactment of the
Act in 1938, and remain so under the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949.59
H. Mgrs. St., 1949, p. 14; Sen. St., 1949 Cong. Rec., p. 15372.

59

(b) Activities constituting actual “production” under statutory definition. It will be noted that the actual
productive work described in this portion of the definition of “produced” includes not only the work involved in
making the products of mining, manufacturing, or processing operations, but also includes “handling, transporting,
or in any other manner working on” goods. This is so, regardless of whether the goods are to be further processed or
are so-called “finished goods.” The Supreme Court has stated that this language of the definition brings within the
scope of the term “production,” as used in the Act, “every step in putting the subject to commerce in a state to enter
commerce,” including “all steps, whether manufacture or not, which lead to readiness for putting goods into the
stream of commerce,” and “every kind of incidental operation preparatory to putting goods into the stream of
commerce.”60

Walling v. Commet Carriers, 151 F. 2d 107 (C.A. 2); Phillips v. Star Overall Dry Cleaning Laundry Co., 149 F. 2d 416 (C.A. 2);
certiorari denied 327 U.S. 780; Walling v. Griffin Cartage Co., 62 F. Supp. 396, affirmed in 153 F. 2d 587 (C.A. 6). For
examples, see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Employees who are not engaged in the actual production Activities described
in section 3(j) of the Act are not engaged in “production” unless their work is “closely related” and “directly essential” to such
production. See §§776.17-776.19.

However, where employees of a common carrier, by handling or working on goods, accomplish the interstate transit
or movement in commerce itself, such handling or working on the goods is not “production.” The employees in that
event are covered only under the phrase “engaged in commerce.”61
Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lenroot, 323 U.S. 490. For examples, see paragraph (c) of this section.

61

(c) Physical labor. It is clear from the principles stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, that
employees in shipping rooms, warehouses, distribution yards, grain elevators, etc., who sort, screen, grade, store,
pack, label, address or otherwise handle or work on goods in preparation for shipment of the goods out of the State
are engaged in the production of goods for commerce within the meaning of the Act.62 The same has been held to be
true of employees doing such work as handling ingredients (scrap iron) of steel used in building ships which will
move in commerce;63 handling and caring for livestock at stockyards where the livestock are destined for interstate
shipment as such64 or as meat products;65 handling or transporting containers to be used in shipping products
interstate;66 transporting, within a single State, oil to a refinery67 or lumber to a mill,68 where products of the refinery
or mill will be sent out of the State; transporting parts or ingredients of other types of goods or the finished goods
themselves between processors, manufacturers, and storage places located in a single State, where goods so
transported will leave the State in the same or an altered form;69 and repairing or otherwise working on ships,70
vehicles,71 machinery,72 clothing,73 or other goods which may be expected to move in interstate commerce.

These examples are, of course, illustrative rather than exhaustive. Some of them relate to situations in which the
handling or working on goods for interstate or foreign commerce may constitute not only “production for
commerce” but also engaging “in commerce” because the activities are so closely related to commerce as to be for
all practical purposes a part of it.74 However, as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, handling or working on goods
constitutes engagement in “commerce” only and not engagement in “production” of the goods when it is done by
employees of a common carrier and is itself the means whereby interstate transit or movement of the goods by the
carrier is accomplished. Thus, employees of a telegraph company preparing messages for interstate transmission,
television cameramen photographing sports or news events for simultaneous viewing at television receiving sets in
other State, and railroad train crews or truck drivers hauling goods from one State to another are not engaged in the
“production” of goods by virtue of such activities, but are covered by the Act only as employees “engaged in
commerce.”

(d) Nonmanual work. The “production” described by the phrase “producing * * * or in any other manner
working on” goods includes not only the manual, physical labor involved in processing and working on the tangible
products of a producing enterprise, but equally the administration, planning, management, and control of the various
physical processes together with the accompanying accounting and clerical activities.75 An enterprise producing
goods for commerce does not accomplish the actual production of such goods solely with employees performing
physical labor on them. Other employees may be equally important in actually producing the goods, such as

employees who conceive and direct policies of the enterprise; employees who dictate, control, and coordinate the
steps involved in the physical production of goods; employees who maintain detailed and meticulous supervision of
productive activities; and employees who direct the purchase of raw materials and supplies, the methods of
production, the amounts to be produced, the quantity and character of the labor, the safety measures, the budgeting
and financing, the labor policies, and the maintenance of the plants and equipment. (For regulations governing
exemption from the wage and hours provisions of employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or
professional capacity, see part 541 of this chapter.) Employees who perform these and similar activities are an
integral part of the coordinated productive pattern of a modern industrial organization. The Supreme Court of the
United States has held that from a productive standpoint and for purposes of the Act the employees who perform
such activities “are actually engaged in the production of goods for commerce just as much as are those who process
and work on the tangible products” in the manufacturing plant or other producing facilities of the enterprise.76

§776.17 Employment in a “closely related process or occupation directly essential to” production of goods.
(a) Coverage in general. Employees who are not actually “producing * * * or in any other manner working
on” goods for commerce are, nevertheless, engaged in the “production” of such goods within the meaning of the Act
and therefore within its general coverage if they are employed “in any closely related process or occupation directly
essential to the production thereof, in any State.”77 Prior to the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, this was
true of employees engaged “in any process or occupation necessary to the production” of goods for commerce. The
amendments deleted the word “necessary” and substituted the words “closely related” and “directly essential”
contained in the present law. The words “directly essential” were adopted by the Conference Committee in lieu of
the word “indispensable” contained in the amendments as first passed by the House of Representatives. Under the
amended language, an employee is covered if the process or occupation in which he is employed is both “closely
related” and “directly essential” to the production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce.
If coverage of an employee is determined to exist on either basis, it is, of course, not necessary to determine whether the
employee would also be covered on the other ground. See Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v. Hall, 124 F. 2d 42 (C.A. 5),
affirmed in 317 U.S. 88.
77

The legislative history shows that the new language in the final clause of section 3(j) of the Act is intended to
narrow, and to provide a more precise guide to, the scope of its coverage with respect to employees (engaged neither
“in commerce” nor in actually “producing or in any other manner working on” goods for commerce) whose
coverage under the Act formerly depended on whether their work was “necessary” to the production of goods for
commerce. Some employees whose work might meet the “necessary” test are now outside the coverage of the Act
because their work is not “closely related” and “directly essential” to such production; others, however, who would
have been excluded if the indispensability of their work to production had been made the test, remain within the
coverage under the new language.78
The scope of coverage under the “closely related” and “directly essential” language is discussed in the paragraphs
following. In the light of explanations provided by managers of the legislation in Congress78 including expressions of
their intention to leave undisturbed the areas of coverage established under court decisions containing similar
language,79 this new language should provide a more definite guide to the intended coverage under the final clause of
section 3(j) than did the earlier “necessary” test. However, while the coverage or noncoverage of many employees
may be determined with reasonable certainty, no precise line for inclusion or exclusion may be drawn; there are
bound to be borderline problems of coverage under the new language which cannot be finally determined except by
authoritative decisions of the courts.

(b) Meaning of “closely related” and “directly essential”. The terms “closely related” and “directly essential”
are not susceptible of precise definition; as used in the Act they together describe a situation in which, under all the
facts and circumstances, the process or occupation in which the employee is employed bears a relationship to the
production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce: (1) Which may reasonably be considered close, as
distinguished from remote or tenuous, and (2) in which the work of the employee directly aids production in a
practical sense by providing something essential to the carrying on in an effective, efficient, and satisfactory manner
of an employer's operations in producing such goods.80
See H. Mgrs. St. 1949, pp. 14, 15; Sen. St., 1949 Cong. Rec., p. 15372; cf. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517.

80

Not all activities that are “closely related” to production will be “directly essential” to it, nor will all activities
“directly essential” to production meet the “closely related” test. For example, employees employed by an employer
in an enterprise, or portion thereof, which is devoted to the production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce
will, as a general rule, be considered engaged in work “closely related” to such production, but some such
employees may be outside the coverage of the Act because their work is not “directly essential” to production of the
goods. (For a discussion of this point and specific illustration, see §776.18(b).) Similarly, there are some situations
in which an employee performing work “directly essential” to production by an employer other than his own may
not be covered because the kind of work and the circumstances under which it is performed show the employee's
activities to be so much a part of an essentially local business operated by his employer that it would be unrealistic
to consider them “closely related” to the productive activities of another. (For a more detailed discussion and
specific illustrations see §776.19.)
(c) Determining whether activities are “closely related” and “directly essential”. (1) The close relationship of
an activity to production, which may be tested by a wide variety of relevant factors, is to be distinguished from its
direct essentiality to production, which is dependent solely on considerations of need or function of the activity in
the productive enterprise. The words “directly essential” refer only to the relationship of the employee's work to
production. Work “directly essential” to production remains so no matter whose employee does it and regardless of
the nature or purpose of the employer's business. It seems clear, on the other hand, that the criteria for determining
whether a process or occupation is “closely related” to production cannot be limited to those which show its
closeness in terms of need or function.81 It may also be important to ascertain, for instance, whether the activity of
the employee bears a relationship to production which is close in terms either of the place or the time of its
performance, or in terms of the purposes with which the activity is performed by the particular employer through the
employee, or in terms of relative directness or indirectness of the activity's effect in relation to such production, or in
terms of employment within or outside the productive enterprise. (Examples of the application of these principles
may be found in §§776.18 and 776.19.)
Of course, if the need of function of the activity in production is such that the tie between them is both close and
immediate (cf. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517), as for example, where an employee is employed to repair electric
motors which are used in factories in the production of goods for commerce, this fact may be sufficient to show both the direct
essentiality and the close relationship of the employee's work to production. See Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657.
See also §776.19 and H. Mgrs. St., 1949, pp. 14, 15.
81

(2) The determination of whether an activity is closely or only remotely related to production may thus
involve consideration of such factors, among others, as the contribution which the activity makes to the production;
who performs the activity; where, when and how it is performed in relation to the production to which it pertains;
whether its performance is with a view to aiding production or for some different purpose; how immediate or
delayed its effect on production is; the number and nature of any intervening operations or processes between the
activity and the production in question; and, in an appropriate case, the characteristics and purposes of the
employer's business.82 Moreover, in some cases where particular work “directly essential” to production is performed
by an employer other than the producer the degree of such essentiality may be a significant factor in determining

whether the work is also “closely related” to such production. (See §776.19.) No one of the factors listed in this
paragraph is necessarily controlling, and other factors may assume importance. Some may have more significance
than others in particular cases, depending upon the facts. They are merely useful guides for determining whether the
total situation in respect to a particular process or occupation demonstrates the requisite “close and immediate tie”83
to the production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce. It is the sum of the factors relevant to each case that
determines whether the particular activity is “closely related” to such production. The application of the principles in
this paragraph is further explained and illustrated in §§776.18 and 776.19.

83

(3) In determining whether an activity is “directly essential” to production, a practical judgment is required as
to whether, in terms of the function and need of such activity in successful production operations, it is “essential”
and “directly” so to such operations. These are questions of degree; even “directly” essential activities (for example,
machinery repair, custodial, and clerical work in a producing plant) (for other examples, see §§776.18(a) and
776.19) will vary in the degree of their essentiality and in the directness of the aid which they provide to production.
An activity may be “directly essential” without being indispensable in the sense that it cannot be done without; yet
some activities which, in a long chain of causation, might be indispensable to production, such as the manufacture of
brick for a new factory, or even the construction of the new factory itself, are not “directly” essential.84 An activity
which provides something essential to meet the immediate needs of production, as, for example, the manufacture of
articles like machinery or tools or dies for use in the production of goods for commerce (see §776.19(b)) will,
however, be no less “directly” essential because intervening activities must be performed in the distribution,
transportation, and installation of such products before they can be used in production.85 The application of the
principles in this paragraph is further explained and illustrated in §§776.18 and 776.19.

§776.18 Employees of producers for commerce.
(a) Covered employments illustrated. Some illustrative examples of the employees employed by a producer of
goods for interstate or foreign commerce who are or are not engaged in the “production” of such goods within the
meaning of the Act have already been given. Among the other employees of such a producer, doing work in
connection with his production of goods for commerce, who are covered because their work, if not actually a part of
such production, is “closely related” and “directly essential” to it,86 are such employees as bookkeepers,
stenographers, clerks, accountants and auditors, employees doing payroll, timekeeping and time study work,
draftsmen, inspectors, testers and research workers, industrial safety men, employees in the personnel, labor
relations, advertising, promotion, and public relations activities of the producing enterprise, work instructors, and
other office and white collar workers; employees maintaining, servicing, repairing or improving the buildings,87
machinery, equipment, vehicles, or other facilities used in the production of goods for commerce,88 and such
custodial and protective employees as watchmen, guards, firemen, patrolmen, caretakers, stockroom workers, and
warehousemen; and transportation workers bringing supplies, materials, or equipment to the producer's premises,
removing slag or other waste materials therefrom, or transporting materials or other goods, or performing such other
transportation activities, as the needs of production may require. These examples are intended as illustrative, rather
than exhaustive of the group of employees of a producer who are “engaged in the production” of goods for
commerce, within the meaning of the Act, and who are therefore entitled to its wage and hours benefits unless
specifically exempted by some provision of the Act.
See H. Mgrs. St., 1949, p. 14; Sen. St., 1949 Cong. Rec., p. 15372. See also Borden Co. v. Borella, 325 U.S. 679.

86

87
No distinction of economic or statutory significance can be drawn between such work in a building where the production
of goods is carried on physically and in one where such production is administered, managed, and controlled. Borden Co. v.
Borella, 324 U.S. 679.

88
Such mechanics and laborers as machinists, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, steamfitters, plasters, glaziers, painters,
metal workers, bricklayers, hod carriers, roofers, stationary engineers, their apprentices and helpers, elevator starters and
operators, messengers, janitors, charwomen, porters, handy men, and other maintenance workers would come within this
category.

(b) Employments not directly essential to production distinguished. Employees of a producer of goods for
commerce are not covered as engaged in such production if they are employed solely in connection with essentially
local activities which are undertaken by the employer independently of his productive operations or at most as a
dispensable, collateral incident to them and not with a view to any direct function which the activities serve in
production. It is clear, for example, that an employee would not be covered merely because he works as a domestic
servant in the home of an employer whose factory produces goods for commerce, even though he is carried on the
factory payroll. To illustrate further, a producer may engage in essentially local activities as a landlord,
restauranteur, or merchant in order to utilize the opportunity for separate and additional profit from such ventures or
to provide a convenient means of meeting personal needs of his employees. Employees exclusively employed in
such activities of the producer are not engaged in work “closely related” and “directly essential” to his production of
goods for commerce merely because they provide residential, eating, or other living facilities for his employees who
are engaged in the production of such goods.89 Such employees are to be distinguished from employees like cooks,
cookees, and bull cooks in isolated lumber camps or mining camps, where the operation of a cookhouse may in fact
be “closely related” and “directly essential” or, indeed, indispensable to the production of goods for commerce.90
H. Mgrs. St., 1949, pp. 14, 15; see also Brogan v. National Surety Co., 246 U.S. 257. Cf. Sen. St., 1949 Cong. Rec., p.

90

Some specific examples of the application of these principles may be helpful. Such services as watching, guarding,
maintaining or repairing the buildings, facilities, and equipment used in the production of goods for commerce are
“directly essential” as well as “closely related” to such production as it is carried on in modern industry.91 But such
services performed with respect to private dwellings tenanted by employees of the producer, as in a mill village,
would not be “directly essential” to production merely because the dwellings were owned by the producer and
leased to his employees.92 Similarly, employees of the producer or of an independent employer who are engaged
only in maintaining company facilities for entertaining the employer's customers, or in providing food, refreshments,
or recreational facilities, including restaurants, cafeterias, and snack bars, for the producer's employees in a factory,
or in operating a children's nursery for the convenience of employees who leave young children there during
working hours, would not be doing work “directly essential” to the production of goods for commerce.93

§776.19 Employees of independent employers meeting needs of producers for commerce.
(a) General statement. (1) If an employee of a producer of goods for commerce would not, while performing
particular work, be “engaged in the production” of such goods for purposes of the Act under the principles
heretofore stated, an employee of an independent employer performing the same work on behalf of the producer

would not be so engaged. Conversely, as shown in the paragraphs following, the fact that employees doing
particular work on behalf of such a producer are employed by an independent employer rather than by the producer
will not take them outside the coverage of the Act if their work otherwise qualifies as the “production” of “goods”
for “commerce.”
(2) Of course, in view of the Act's definition of “goods” as including “any part or ingredient” of goods (see
§776.20 (a), (c)), employees of an independent employer providing other employers with materials or articles which
become parts or ingredients of goods produced by such other employers for commerce are actually employed by a
producer of goods for commerce and their coverage under the Act must be considered in the light of this fact. For
example, an employee of such an independent employer who handles or in any manner works on the goods which
become parts or ingredients of such other producer's goods is engaged in actual production of goods (parts of
ingredients) for commerce, and the question of his coverage is determined by this fact without reference to whether
his work is “closely related” and “directly essential” to the production by the other employer of the goods in which
such parts or ingredients are incorporated. So also, if the employee is not engaged in the actual production of such
parts or ingredients, his coverage will depend on whether as an employee of a producer of goods for commerce, his
work is “closely related” and “directly essential” to the production of the parts or ingredients, rather than on the
principles applicable in determining the coverage of employees of an independent employer who does not himself
produce the goods for commerce.94

5).

(3) Where the work of an employee would be “closely related” and “directly essential” to the production of
goods for commerce if he were employed by a producer of the goods, the mere fact that the employee is employed
by an independent employer will not justify a different answer.95 This does not necessarily mean that such work in
every case will remain “closely related” to production when performed by employees of an independent employer. It
will, of course, be as “directly essential” to production in the one case as in the other. (See §776.17(c)). But in
determining whether an employee's work is “closely” or only remotely related to the production of goods for
commerce by an employer other than his own, the nature and purpose of the business in which he is employed and
in the course of which he performs the work may sometimes become important.
See Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517; Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657; Farmers Reservoir Co. v.
McComb, 337 U.S. 755; H. Mgrs. St., 1949, p. 14. See also Sen. St., 1949 Cong. Rec., p. 15372.
95

Such factors may prove decisive in particular situations where the employee's work, although “directly essential” to
the production of goods by someone other than his employer, is not far from the borderline between those activities
which are “directly essential” and those which are not. In such a situation, it may appear that his performance of the
work is so much a part of an essentially local business carried on by his employer without any intent or purpose of
aiding production of goods for commerce by others that the work, as thus performed, may not reasonably be
considered “closely related” to such production.96 In other situations, however, where the degree to which the work
is directly essential to production by the producer is greater the fact that the independent employer is engaged in a
business having local aspects may not be sufficient to negate a close relationship between his employees' work and
such production.97 And it seems clear that where the independent employer operates a business which, unlike that of
the ordinary local merchant, is directed to providing producers with materials or services directly essential to the
production of their goods for commerce, the activities of such a business may be found to be “closely related” to
such production.98 In such event, all the employees of the independent employer whose work is part of his integrated
effort to meet such needs of producers are covered as engaged in work closely related and directly essential to
production of goods for commerce.99

bookkeeper, salesman, dispatcher of company supplying burglar alarm service to producers).

In H. Mgrs. St., 1949, p. 14 it is said, “Employees engaged in such maintenance, custodial and clerical work will remain
subject to the Act, notwithstanding they are employed by an independent employer performing such work on behalf of the
manufacturer, mining company, or other producer for commerce. All such employees perform activities that are closely related
and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce.”

(b) Extent of coverage under “closely related” and “directly essential” clause illustrated. In paragraphs (b)(1)
to (5) of this section, the principles discussed above are illustrated by reference to a number of typical situations in
which goods or services are provided to producers of goods for commerce by the employees of independent
employers. These examples are intended not only to answer questions as to coverage in the particular situations
discussed, but to provide added guideposts for determining whether employees in other situations are doing work
closely related and directly essential to such production.
(1) Many local merchants sell to local customers within the same State goods which do not become a part or
ingredient (as to parts or ingredients, see §776.20(c)) of goods produced by any of such customers. Such a merchant
may sell to his customers, including producers for commerce, such articles, for example, as paper towels, or record
books, or paper clips, or filing cabinets, or automobiles and trucks, or paint, or hardware, not specially designed for
use in the production of other goods.
Where such a merchant's business is essentially local in nature, selling its goods to the usual miscellany of local
customers without any particular intent or purpose of aiding production of other goods for commerce by such
customers, the local merchant's employees are not doing work both “closely related” and “directly essential” to
production, so as to bring them within the reach of the Act, merely “because some of the customers * * * are
producing goods for interstate [or foreign] commerce.”1 Therefore, if they do not otherwise engage “in commerce”
(see §§776.8 to 776.13) or in the “production” of goods for commerce, they are not covered by the Act.
1

H. Mgrs. St., 1949, pp. 14, 15.

In such a situation, moreover, even where the work done by the employees is “directly essential” to such production
by their employer's customers, it may not meet the “closely related” test. But the more directly essential to the
production of goods for commerce such work is, the more likely it is that a close and immediate tie between it and
such production exists which will be sufficient, notwithstanding the local aspect of the employer's business, to bring
the employees within the coverage of the Act on the ground that their work is “closely related” as well as “directly
essential” to production by the employer's customers.
Such a close and immediate tie with production exists, for example, where the independent employer, through his
employees, supplies producers of goods for commerce with things as directly essential to production as electric
motors or machinery or machinery parts for use in producing the goods of a manufacturer, for mining operations, or
for production of oil, or for other production operations or the power, water, or fuel required in such production
operations, to mention a few typical examples.2 The fact that these needs of producers are supplied through the
agency of businesses having certain local aspects cannot alter the obvious fact that the employees of such businesses
who supply these needs are doing work both “closely related” and “directly essential” to production by the
employer's customers. As the United States Supreme Court has stated: “Such sales and services must be
immediately available to * * * [the customers] or their production will stop.”3

It should be noted that employees of independent employers providing such essential goods and services to
producers will not be removed from coverage because an unsegregated portion of their work is performed for
customers other than producers of goods for commerce. For example, employees of public utilities, furnishing gas,
electricity or water to firms within the State engaged in manufacturing, mining, or otherwise producing goods for
commerce, are subject to the Act notwithstanding such gas, electricity or water is also furnished to consumers who
do not produce goods for commerce.4

(2) On similar principles, employees of independent employers providing to manufacturers, mining
companies, or other producers such goods used in their production of goods for commerce as tools and dies,
patterns, designs, or blueprints are engaged in work “closely related” as well as “directly essential” to the production
of the goods for commerce;5 the same is true of employees of an independent employer engaged in such work as
producing and supplying to a steel mill, sand meeting the mill's specifications for cast shed, core, and molding sands
used in the production by the mill of steel for commerce.6 Another illustration of such covered work, according to
managers of the bill in Congress, is that of employees of industrial laundry and linen supply companies serving the
needs of customers engaged in manufacturing or mining goods for commerce.7

On the other hand, the legislative history makes it clear that employees of a “local architectural firm” are not
brought within the coverage of the Act by reason of the fact that their activities “include the preparation of plans for
the alteration of buildings within the State which are used to produce goods for interstate commerce.” Such activities
are not “directly essential” enough to the production of goods in the buildings to establish the required close
relationship between their performance and such production when they are performed by employees of such a
“local” firm.8 Of course, this result is even more apparent where the activities of the employees of such a “local”
business may not be viewed as “directly essential” to production. It is clear, for example, that Congress did not
believe “employees of an independently owned and operated restaurant” should be brought under the coverage of
the Act because the restaurant is “located in a factory.” To establish coverage on “production” grounds, an employee
must be “shown to have a closer and more direct relationship to the producing * * * activity” than this.9

(3) Some further examples may help to clarify the line to be drawn in such cases. The work of employees
constructing a dike to prevent the flooding of an oil field producing oil for commerce would clearly be work not
only “directly essential” but also “closely related” to the production of the oil. However, employees of a
materialman quarrying, processing, and transporting stone to the construction site for use in the dike would be doing
work too far removed from production of the oil to be considered “closely related” thereto.10 Similarly, the sale of
sawmill equipment to a producer of mine props which are in turn sold to mines within the same State producing coal
for commerce is too remote from production of the coal to be considered “closely related” thereto, but production of
the mine props, like the manufacture of tools, dies, or machinery for use in producing goods for commerce, has such

a close and immediate tie with production of the goods for commerce that it meets the “closely related” (as well as
the “directly essential”) test.11
See E. C. Schroeder Co. v. Clifton, 153 F. 2d 385 (C.A. 10) (opinion of Judge Phillips) and H. Mgrs. St., 1949, p. 15.

Labor explaining the conference agreement to the House of Representatives, 1949 Cong. Rec., p. 15135.

(4) A further illustration of the distinction between work that is, and work that is not, “closely related” to the
production of goods for commerce may be found in situations involving activities which are directly essential to the
production by farmers of farm products which are shipped in commerce. Employees of an employer furnishing to
such farmers, within the same State, water for the irrigation of their crops, power for use in their agricultural
production for commerce, or seed from which the crops grow, are engaged in work “closely related” as well as
“directly essential” to the production of goods for commerce.12 On the other hand, it is apparent from the legislative
history that Congress did not regard, as “closely related” to the production of farm products for commerce, the
activities of employees in a local fertilizer plant producing fertilizer for use by farmers within the same State to
improve the productivity of the land used in growing such products.13 Fertilizer is ordinarily thought to be
assimilated by the soil rather than by the crop and, in the ordinary case, may be considered less directly essential to
production of farm products than the water or seed, without which such production would not be possible. Probably
the withdrawal from coverage of such employees (who were held “necessary” to production of goods for commerce
under the Act prior to the 1949 amendments14) rests wholly or in part on the principles stated in paragraph (a)(3) of
this section and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Heretofore the Department has taken the position that producing or
supplying feed for poultry and livestock to be used by farmers within the State in the production of poultry or cattle
for commerce was covered. The case of Mitchell v. Garrard Mills15 has reached a contrary conclusion as to a local
producer of such feed in a situation where all of the feed was sold to farmers and dealers for use exclusively within
the State. For the time being, and until further clarification from the courts, the Divisions will not assert the position
that coverage exists under the factual situation which existed in this case.

(5) Managers of the legislation in Congress stated that all maintenance, custodial, and clerical employees of
manufacturers, mining companies, and other producers of goods for commerce perform activities that are both
“closely related” and “directly essential” to the production of goods for commerce, and that the same is true of
employees of an independent employer performing such maintenance, custodial, and clerical work “on behalf of”
such producers.
Typical of the employees in this covered group are those repairing or maintaining the machinery or buildings used
by the producer in his production of goods for commerce and employees of a watchman or guard or patrol or burglar
alarm service protecting the producer's premises.16 On the other hand, the House managers of the bill made it clear
that employees engaged in cleaning windows or cutting grass at the plant of a producer of goods for commerce were
not intended to be included as employees doing work “closely related” to production on “on behalf of” the producer
where they were employed by a “local window-cleaning company” or a “local independent nursery concern,”
merely because the customers of the employer happen to include producers of goods for commerce.17 A similar view
was expressed with respect to employees of a “local exterminator service firm” working wholly within the State

exterminating pests in private homes, in a variety of local establishments, “and also in buildings within the State
used to produce goods for interstate commerce.”17

[15 FR 2925, May 17, 1950, as amended at 22 FR 9692, Dec. 4, 1957]

§776.20 “Goods.”
(a) The statutory provision. An employee is covered by the wage and hours provisions of the Act if he is
engaged in the “production” (as explained in §§776.15 through 776.19) “for commerce” (as explained in §776.21) of
anything defined as “goods” in section 3(i) of the Act. This definition is:
Goods means goods (including ships and marine equipment), wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles or
subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof, but does not include goods after their delivery into the
actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer thereof other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor thereof.

(b) “Articles or subjects of commerce of any character.” It will be observed that “goods” as defined in the Act
are not limited to commercial goods or articles of trade, or, indeed, to tangible property, but include “articles or
subjects of commerce of any character (emphasis supplied).18 It is well settled that things such as “ideas, * * *
orders, and intelligence” are “subjects of commerce.” Telegraphic messages have, accordingly, been held to be
“goods” within the meaning of the Act.19 Other articles or subjects of commerce which fall within the definition of
“goods” include written materials such as newspapers, magazines, brochures, pamphlets, bulletins, and
announcements;20 written reports, fiscal and other statements and accounts, correspondence, lawyers' briefs and other
documents;21 advertising, motion picture, newspaper and radio copy, artwork and manuscripts for publication;22
sample books;23 letterheads, envelopes, shipping tags, labels, check books, blank books, book covers, advertising
circulars and candy wrappers.24 Insurance policies are “goods” within the meaning of the Act;25 so are bonds, stocks,
bills of exchange, bills of lading, checks, drafts, negotiable notes and other commercial paper.26 “Goods” includes
gold;27 livestock;28 poultry and eggs;29 vessels;30 vehicles;31 aircraft;32 garments being laundered or rented;33 ice;34
containers, as, for example, cigar boxes or wrapping paper and packing materials for other goods shipped in
commerce;35 electrical energy or power, gas, etc.;36 and by-products,37 to mention only a few illustrations of the
articles or subjects of “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States, or
between any State and any place outside thereof” which the Act refers to as “goods.” The Act's definitions do not,
however, include as “goods” such things as dams, river improvements, highways and viaducts, or railroad lines.38
18
As pointed out in Lenroot v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 F. 2d 400 (C.A. 2), the legislative history shows that the
definition was originally narrower, and that subjects of commerce were added by a Senate amendment.

21

that such things are “goods” only when they are articles of trade. Although the Supreme Court has not settled the question, such a

(c) “Any part or ingredient.” Section 3(i) draws no distinction between goods and their ingredients and in fact
defines goods to mean “goods” * * * or any part or ingredient thereof.” The fact that goods are processed or
changed in form by several employers before going into interstate or foreign commerce does not affect the character
of the original product as “goods” produced for commerce. Thus, if a garment manufacturer sends goods to an
independent contractor within the State to have them sewn, after which he further processes and ships them in
interstate commerce, the division of the production functions between the two employees does not alter the fact that
the employees of the independent contractor are actually producing (“working on”) the “goods” (parts or ingredients
of goods) which enter the channels of commerce.39

Similarly, if a manufacturer of buttons sells his products within the State to a manufacturer of shirts, who ships the
shirts in interstate commerce, the employees of the button manufacturer would be engaged in the production of
goods for commerce; or, if a lumber manufacturer sells his lumber locally to a furniture manufacturer who sells
furniture in interstate commerce, the employees of the lumber manufacturer would likewise come within the scope
of the Act. Any employee who is engaged in the “production” (as explained in §776.15) of any part or ingredient of
goods produced for trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or
between any State and any place outside thereof is engaged in the production of “goods” for commerce within the
meaning of the Act.40

40

(d) Effect of the exclusionary clause. The exclusionary clause in the definition that excepts “goods after their
delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer thereof other than a producer, manufacturer, or
processor thereof,” is intended to protect ultimate consumers other than producers, manufacturers, or processors of
the goods in question41 from the “hot goods” provisions of section 15(a)(1) of the Act.42 Section 15(a)(1) makes it
unlawful for any person “to transport * * * (or * * * ship * * * in commerce * * * any goods” produced in
violation of the wage and hours standards established by the Act. (Exceptions are made subject to specified
conditions for common carriers and for certain purchasers acting in good faith reliance on written statements of
compliance. See footnote 53 to §776.15(a).) By defining “goods” in section 3(i) so as to exclude goods after their
delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer (other than a producer, manufacturer, or
processor thereof) Congress made it clear that it did not intend to hold the ultimate consumer as a violator of section
15(a)(1) if he should transport “hot goods” across a State line.43 Thus, if a person purchases a pair of shoes for
himself from a retail store44 and carries the shoes across a State line, the purchaser is not guilty of a violation of
section 15(a)(1) if the shoes were produced in violation of the wage or hours provisions of the statute. But the fact
that goods produced for commerce lose their character as “goods” after they come into the actual physical
possession of an ultimate consumer who does not further process or work on them, does not affect their character as
“goods” while they are still in the actual physical possession of the producer, manufacturer or processor who is
handling or working on them with the intent or expectation that they will subsequently enter interstate or foreign
commerce.45 Congress clearly did not intend to permit an employer to avoid the minimum wage and maximum hours
standards of the Act by making delivery within the State into the actual physical possession of the ultimate
consumer who transports or ships the goods outside of the State. Thus, employees engaged in building a boat for
delivery to the purchaser at the boatyard are considered within the coverage of the Act if the employer, at the time
the boat is being built, intends, hopes, or has reason to believe that the purchase will sail it outside the State.46

§776.21 “For” commerce.

(a) General principles. As has been made clear previously, where “goods” (as defined in the Act) are produced
“for commerce,” every employee engaged in the “production” (as explained in §§776.15 through 776.19) of such
goods (including any part or ingredient thereof) is within the general coverage of the wage and hours provisions of
the Act. Goods are produced for “commerce” if they are produced for “trade, commerce, transporation,
transmission, or communication among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.”47
Goods are produced “for” such commerce where the employer intends, hopes, expects, or has reason to believe that
the goods or any unsegregated part of them will move (in the same or in an altered form or as a part or ingredient of
other goods) in such interstate or foreign commerce.48 If such movement of the goods in commerce can be
reasonably anticipated by the employer when his employees perform work defined in the Act as “production” of
such goods, it makes no difference whether he himself, or a subsequent owner or possessor of the goods, put the
goods in interstate or foreign commerce.49 The fact that goods do move in interstate or foreign commerce is strong
evidence that the employer intended, hoped, expected, or had reason to believe that they would so move.

Schulte Co. v. Gangi, 328 U.S. 108; Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v. Hall, 417 U.S. 88. See paragraph (d) of this

49

section.

Although it is generally well understood that goods are produced “for” commerce if they are produced for
movement in commerce to points outside the State, questions have been raised as to whether work done on goods
may constitute production “for” commerce even though the goods do not ultimately leave the State. As is explained
more fully in the paragraphs following, there are certain situations in which this may be true, either under the
principles above stated (see paragraph (c) of this section), or because it appears that the goods are produced “for”
commerce in the sense that they are produced for use directly in the furtherance, within the particular State, of the
actual movement to, from, or across such State or interstate or foreign commerce. (See paragraph (b) of this section).
(b) Goods produced for direct furtherance of interstate movement. (1) The Act's definition of “commerce,” as
has been seen, describes a movement, among the several States or between any State and any outside place, of trade,
commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication.” Whenever goods are produced “for” such movement,
such goods are produced “for commerce,” whether or not there is any expectation or reason to anticipate that the
particular goods will leave the State.50
Fleming v. Atlantic Co., 40 F. Supp. 654, affirmed in 131 F. 2d 518 (C.A. 5).

50

(2) The courts have held that particular goods are produced “for” commerce when they are produced with a
view to their use, whether within or without the State, in the direct furtherance of the movement of interstate or
foreign commerce. Thus, it is well settled that ice is produced “for” commerce when it is produced for use by
interstate rail or motor carriers in the refrigeration or cooling of the equipment in which the interstate traffic actually
moves, even though the particular ice may melt before the equipment in which it is placed leaves the State.51 The
goods (ice) produced for such use “enter into the very means of transportation by which the burdens of traffic are
borne.”52 The same may be said of electrical energy produced and sold within a single State for such uses as lighting
and operating signals on railroads and at airports to guide interstate traffic, lighting and operating radio stations
transmitting programs interstate, and lighting and message transmission of telephone and telegraph companies.53
Similar principles would apply to the production of fuel or water for use in the operation of railroads with which
interstate and foreign commerce is carried on; the production of radio or television scripts which provide the basis
for programs transmitted interstate; the production of telephone and telegraph poles for use in the necessary repair,
maintenance, or improvement of interstate communication systems; the production of crushed rock, ready-mixed
concrete, cross-ties, concrete culvert pipe, bridge timbers, and similar items for use in the necessary repair,
maintenance, or improvement of railroad roadbeds and bridges which serve as the instrumentalities over which
interstate traffic moves.

Similarly, in the case of highways, pipe lines, and waterways which serve as instrumentalities of interstate and
foreign commerce, the production of goods for use in the direct furtherance of the movement of commerce thereon
would be the production of goods “for commerce.” The production of materials54 for use in the necessary
maintenance, repair, or improvement of the instrumentality so that the flow of commerce will not be impeded or
impaired is an example of this. Thus, stone or ready-mixed concrete, crushed rock, sand, gravel, and similar
materials for bridges or dams; like materials or bituminous aggregate or oil for road surfacing; concrete or
galvanized pipe for road drainage; bridge planks and timbers; paving blocks; and other such materials may be
produced “for” commerce even though they do not leave the State.

Engebretson v. Albrecht, 150 F. 2d 602 (C.A. 7).

(3) This does not, however, necessarily mean that the production of such materials within a State is always
production “for” commerce when the materials are used in the same State for the maintenance, repair, or
improvement of highways or other instrumentalities carrying interstate traffic. In determining whether the
production is actually “for” commerce in a situation where there is no reason to believe that the goods will leave the
State, a practical judgment is required. Some illustrations may be helpful.
On the one hand, there are situations where there is little room for doubt that the goods are produced “for”
commerce in the sense that the goods are intended for the direct furtherance of the movement of commerce over the
instrumentalities of transportation and communication. The most obvious illustration is that of special-purpose
goods such as cross-ties for railroads, telephone or telegraph poles, or concrete pipe designed for highway use.
Another illustration is sand and gravel for highway repair or reconstruction which is produced from a borrow pit
opened expressly for that purpose, or from the pits of an employer whose business operations are conducted wholly
or in the substantial part with the intent or purpose of filling highway contracts. (The fact that a substantial portion
of the employer's gross income is derived from supplying such materials for highway repair and reconstruction
would be one indication that a substantial part of his business is directed to the purpose of meeting such needs of
commerce.)
On the other hand, there are situations where materials or other goods used in maintaining, repairing, or
reconstructing instrumentalities of commerce are produced and supplied by local materialmen under circumstances
which may require the conclusion that the goods are not produced “for” commerce. Thus, a materialman may be
engaged in an essentially local business serving the usual miscellany of local customers, without any substantial part
of such business being directed to meeting the needs of highway repair or reconstruction. If, on occasion, he happens
to produce or supply some materials which are used within the State to meet such highway needs, and he does so as
a mere incident of his essentially local business, the Administrator will not consider that his employees handling or
working on such materials are producing goods “for” commerce. This is, rather, a typically local activity of the kind
the Act was not intended to cover. The same may be said of the production of ice by an essentially local ice plant
where the only basis of coverage is the delivery of ice for the water cooler in the community railroad station. The
employees producing ice in the ice plant for local use would not by reason of this be covered as engaged in the
production of goods “for” commerce.
Other illustrations might be given but these should emphasize the essential distinction which must be kept in mind.
Borderline cases will, of course, arise. In each such case the facts must be examined and a determination made as to
whether or not the goods may fairly be viewed as produced “for” use in the direct furtherance of the movement of
interstate or foreign commerce, and thus “for” commerce.

(c) Controlling effect of facts at time “production” occurs. (1) Whether employees are engaged in the
production of goods “for” commerce depends upon circumstances as they exist at the time the goods are being
produced, not upon some subsequent event. Thus, if a lumber manufacturer produces lumber to fill an out-of-State
order, the employees working on the lumber are engaged in the production of goods for commerce and within the
coverage of the Act's wage and hours provisions, even though the lumber does not ultimately leave the State because
it is destroyed by fire before it can be shipped. Similarly, employees drilling for oil which the employer expects to
leave the State either as crude oil or refined products are engaged in the production of goods for commerce while the
drilling operations are going on and are entitled to be paid on that basis notwithstanding some of the wells drilled
may eventually prove to be dry holes.55
Culver v. Bell & Loffland, 146 F. 2d 29 (C.A. 9); see also Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v. Hall, 317 U.S. 88.

55

(2) On the other hand, if the lumber manufacturer first mentioned produces lumber to fill the order of a local
contractor in the expectation that it will be used to build a schoolhouse within the State, the employees producing
the lumber are not engaged in the production of goods “for” commerce and are not covered by the Act. This would
remain true notwithstanding the contractor subsequently goes bankrupt and the lumber is sold to a purchaser who
moves it to another State; the status of the employees for purposes of coverage cannot in this situation, any more
than in the others, be retroactively changed by the subsequent event.
(d) Goods disposed of locally to persons who place them in commerce. It is important to remember that if, at
the time when employees engage in activities which constitute “production of goods” within the meaning of the Act,
their employer intends, hopes, expects, or has reason to believe that such goods will be taken or sent out of the State
by a subsequent purchaser or other person into whose possession the goods will come, this is sufficient to establish
that such employees are engaged in the production of such goods “for” commerce and covered by the Act. Whether
the producer passes title to the goods to another within the State is immaterial.56 The goods are produced “for”
commerce in such a situation whether they are purchased f.o.b. the factory and are taken out of the State by the
purchaser, or whether they are sold within the State to a wholesaler or retailer or manufacturer or processor who in
turn sells them, either in the same form or after further processing, in interstate or foreign commerce. The same is
true where the goods worked on by the producer's employees are not owned by the producer and are returned, after
the work is done, to the possession of the owner who takes or sends them out of the State.57 Similarly, employees are
engaged in the production of goods “for” commerce when they are manufacturing, handling, working on, or
otherwise engaging in the production of boxes, barrels, bagging, crates, bottles, or other containers, wrapping or
packing material which their employer has reason to believe will be used to hold the goods of other producers which
will be sent out of the State in such containers or wrappings. It makes no difference that such other producers are
located in the same State and that the containers are sold and delivered to them there.58

It should be noted that where empty containers are purchased, loaded, or transported within a single State as a part of their

Subpart B—Construction Industry
SOURCE: 21 FR 5439, July 20, 1956, unless otherwise noted.

§776.22 Subpart limited to individual employee coverage.

This subpart, which was adopted before the amendments of 1961 and 1966 to the Fair Labor Standards Act, is
limited to discussion of the traditional general coverage of employees employed in activities of the character
performed in the construction industry, which depends on whether such employees are, individually, “engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce” within the meaning of the Act. The 1961 and 1966
amendments broadened coverage by extending it to other employees of the construction industry on an “enterprise”
basis, as explained in §776.22a. Employees covered under the principles discussed in this subpart remain covered
under the Act as amended; however, an employee who would not be individually covered under the principles
discussed in this subpart may now be subject to the Act if he is employed in an enterprise engaged in covered
construction as defined in the amendments.
[35 FR 5543, Apr. 3, 1970]

ENTERPRISE COVERAGE
§776.22a Extension of coverage to employment in certain enterprises.
Whether or not individually covered on the traditional basis, an employee is covered on an “enterprise” basis
by the Act as amended in 1961 and 1966 if he is “employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce” as defined in section 3 (r), (s), of the Act. “Enterprise” is defined generally by
section 3(r) to mean “the related activities performed (either through unified operation or common control) by any
person or persons for a common business purpose, and includes all such activities whether performed in one or more
establishments or by one or more corporate or other organizational units.” If an “enterprise” as thus defined is an
“enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce” as defined and described in section
3(s) of the Act as amended, any employee employed in such enterprise is subject to the provisions of the Act to the
same extent as if he were individually engaged “in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce”, unless
specifically exempt, section 3(s), insofar as pertinent to the construction industry, reads as follows:
Enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce means an enterprise which has employees
engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, including employees handling, selling, or otherwise working
on goods that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person, and which:

* * * * *
(3) Is engaged in the business of construction or reconstruction, or both.

Questions of “enterprise coverage” in the construction industry which are not answered in published statements of
the Department of Labor may be addressed to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Department of
Labor, Washington, DC 20210, or assistance may be requested from any of the Regional or District Offices of the
Division.
[35 FR 5543, Apr. 3, 1970]

INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE COVERAGE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
§776.22b Guiding principles.
(a) Scope of bulletin and general coverage statement. This subpart contains the opinions of the Administrator
of the Wage and Hour Division with respect to the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act to employees
engaged in the building and construction industry. The provisions of the Act expressly make its application
dependent on the character of an employee's activities, that is, on whether he is engaged “in commerce” or in the
“production of goods for commerce including any closely related process or occupation directly essential to such
production.” Under either of the two prescribed areas of covered work, coverage cannot be determined by a rigid or
technical formula. The United States Supreme Court has said of both phases that coverage must be given “a liberal

construction” determined “by practical considerations, not by technical conceptions.”1 The Court has specifically
rejected the technical “new construction” concept, as a reliable test for determining coverage under this Act.2
1
Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., 349 U.S. 427; Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517; Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin,
345 U.S. 13.

2

Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante.

So far as construction work specifically is concerned, the courts have cast the relevant tests for determining the
scope of “in commerce” coverage in substantially similar language as they have used in construing the “production”
phase of coverage. Thus the Act applies to construction work which is so intimately related to the functioning of
interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, as well as to construction work which has a close and
immediate tie with the process of production.3
3

Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante; Cf. Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126.

(b) Engagement in commerce. The United States Supreme Court has held that the “in commerce” phase of
coverage extends “throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce,” and covers not only
construction work physically in or on a channel or instrumentality of interstate commerce but also construction work
“so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be, in
practical effect, a part of it, rather than isolated, local activity.”4
4
Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante; Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564; Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318
U.S. 125.

(c) Production of goods for commerce. The “production” phase of coverage includes “any closely related
process or occupation directly essential” to production of goods for commerce. An employee need not be engaged in
activities indispensable to production in order to be covered. Conversely, even indispensable or essential activities,
in the sense of being included in the long line of causation which ultimately results in production of finished goods,
may not be covered. The work must be both closely related and directly essential to the covered production.5
5

Armour & Co. v. Wantock, ante; Kirschbaum v. Walling, 316 U.S. 417; Cf. 10 E. 40th St. Co. v. Callus, 325 U.S. 578.

(d) State and national authority. Consideration must also be given to the relationship between state and
national authority because Congress intended “to leave local business to the protection of the State.”6 Activities
which superficially appear to be local in character, when isolated, may in fact have the required close or intimate
relationship with the area of commerce to which the Act applies. The courts have stated that a project should be
viewed as a whole in a realistic way and not broken down into its various phases so as to defeat the purposes of the
Act.7

776.21(b).

(e) Interpretations. In his task of distinguishing covered from non-covered employees the Administrator will
be guided by authoritative court decisions. To the extent that prior administrative rulings, interpretations, practices
and enforcement policies relating to employees in the construction industry are inconsistent or in conflict with the
principles stated in this subpart, they are hereby rescinded and withdrawn.

§776.23 Employment in the construction industry.

(a) In general. The same principles for determining coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act generally
apply to employees in the building and construction industry. As in other situations, it is the employee's activities
rather than the employer's business which is the important consideration, and it is immaterial if the employer is an
independent contractor who performs the construction work for or on behalf of a firm which is engaged in interstate
commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce.8

Construction Co. and L. H. Chambers v. Mitchell, decided June 5, 1965 (C.A. 8).

(b) On both covered and non-covered work. If the employee is engaged in both covered and non-covered work
during the workweek he is entitled to the benefits of the Act for the entire week regardless of the amount of covered
activities which are involved. The covered activities must, however, be regular or recurring rather than isolated,
sporadic or occasional.9
9

See General Coverage Bulletin, §§776.2 and 776.4

(c) On covered construction projects. All employees who are employed in connection with construction work
which is closely or intimately related to the functioning of existing instrumentalities and channels of interstate
commerce or facilities for the production of goods for such commerce are within the scope of the Act. Closely or
intimately related construction work includes the maintenance, repair, reconstruction, redesigning, improvement,
replacement, enlargement or extension of a covered facility.10 If the construction project is subject to the Act, all
employees who participate in the integrated effort are covered, including not only those who are engaged in work at
the site of the construction such as mechanics, laborers, handymen, truckdrivers, watchmen, guards, timekeepers,
inspectors, checkers, surveyors, payroll workers, and repair men, but also office, clerical, bookkeeping, auditing,
promotional, drafting, engineering, custodial and stock room employees.11

11

(d) On non-covered construction projects. (1) A construction project maybe purely local and, therefore, not
covered, but some individual employees may nonetheless be covered on independent ground by reason of their
interstate activities. Under the principle that coverage depends upon the particular activities of the employee and not
on the nature of the business of the employer, individual employees engaged in interstate activities are covered even
though their activities may be performed in connection with a non-covered construction project. Thus, the Act is
applicable to employees who are regularly engaged in ordering or procuring materials and equipment from outside
the State or receiving, unloading, checking, watching or guarding such goods while they are still in transit. For
example, laborers on a non-covered construction project who regularly unload materials and equipment from
vehicles or railroad cars which are transporting such articles from other States are performing covered work.12
Clyde v. Broderick, 144 F. (2d) 348 (C.A. 10); Durnil v. J. E. Dunn Construction Co. 186 F (2d) 27 (C.A. 8), Donahue v.
George A. Fuller Co., 104 F. Supp. 145; Cf. Mitchell v. Royal Baking Co., 219 F. (2d) 532 (C.A. 5).
12

(2) Similarly, employees who regularly use instrumentalities of commerce, such as the telephone, telegraph
and mails for interstate communication are within the scope of the Act, as are employees who are regularly engaged
in preparing, handling, or otherwise working on goods which will be sent to other States. This includes the
preparation of plans, orders, estimates, accounts, reports and letters for interstate transmittal.
§776.24 Travel in connection with construction projects.

The Act also applies to employees who regularly travel across State lines in the performance of their duties,
even though the construction project itself is not covered.13 If an employee regularly transports persons, materials, or
equipment between jobs across State lines, or to a covered project, even within the State, as part of his duties for the
contractor, he would be covered. As in other situations, the Act would not apply if crossing State lines or
transporting persons, materials or equipment by the employee was isolated or sporadic rather than regular and
recurring. Also, ordinary home-to-work travel, even across State lines, is not covered.
Reck v. Zarmacay, 264 App. Div. 520, 36 N.Y.S. (2d) 394; Colbeck v. Dairyland Creamery Co., 17 N.W. (2d) 262 (S. Ct.

13

S.D.).

§776.25 Regular and recurring activities as basis of coverage.
Regular and recurring may mean a very small amount and is not to be determined by volume or percentages.
Coverage depends on the character rather than the volume of the employee's activities. For example, if an employee
in the course of his duties regularly engages in covered work even though the covered work constitutes only a small
part of his duties, he would be covered in any week when he performs such covered work.14
Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., ante; Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co., 327 U.S. 178.

14

§776.26 Relationship of the construction work to the covered facility.
Unless the construction work is physically or functionally integrated or closely identified with an existing
covered facility it is not regarded as covered construction because it is not closely enough related to or integrated
with the production of goods for commerce or the engagement in commerce. For this reason the erection,
maintenance or repair of dwellings, apartments, hotels, churches and schools are not covered projects.15 Similarly the
construction of a separate, wholly new, factory building, not constructed as an integral part or as an improvement of
an existing covered production plant, is not covered (Cf. §776.27(c)). Coverage of any construction work, whether
new or repair work, depends upon how closely integrated it is with, and how essential it is to the functioning of,
existing covered facilities. Neither the mere fact that the construction is “new construction” nor the fact that it is
physically separated from an existing covered plant, is determinative. Moreover, the court decisions make it clear
that the construction project itself need not be actually employed in commerce or in the production of goods for
commerce during the time of its construction in order to be covered.16 Such factors may be considered in determining
whether as a practical matter the work is directly and vitally related to the functioning of the covered facility but
would not be decisive.
Cf. §776.18(b).

U.S. 915.

§776.27 Construction which is related to covered production.
(a) Existing production establishments. (1) Covered production facilities within the concept of the Act include
mines, oil wells, banks, manufacturing, packing and processing plants, filtration, sewage treatment, electric power
and water plants, shipyards, warehouses in which goods are broken down, packed or handled preparatory to being
sent in interstate commerce, and similar establishments.
(2) The repair or maintenance of a covered production unit is essential for its continued operation and has a
close and immediate tie with the production of goods for commerce.17 The Act is also applicable to other
construction which is an integral part of a covered production unit, such as the replacement, enlargement,
reconstruction, extension or other improvement of the premises, the buildings, the machinery, tools and dies and
other equipment. Functionally such work is like maintenance and repair and is necessary for the continued, efficient
and effective operation of the facility as a unit. Thus the construction of new appurtenances of a covered production

establishment such as parking aprons, access roads, railroad spurs, drainage ditches, storm, waste and sanitary
sewers or adjacent integrated buildings is subject to the Act. Similarly, the Act applies to the installation of
telephone, electric, gas and water lines, machinery and other equipment on the premises of such a facility.

17

(3) On the other hand, the production and furnishings, within the State, of construction materials, such as sand,
gravel, brick and other construction materials produced for general local use, is not covered even if the producer also
supplies such materials to construction companies which use them within the State in the repair, maintenance or
improvement of facilities for the production of goods for commerce. Employees of the materialman in such a
situation would not have such a close and immediate tie to the production of goods for commerce as to be
considered “closely related” and “directly essential” to such production.18
18
See General Coverage Bulletin, §776.19(b)(3); but see §776.19 (b) (1), (2) and (3); on coverage of furnishing materials
“specially designed”, or meeting particular specifications, for use in production of particular kinds of goods for commerce; and
paragraph (d) of this section, on coverage of producing and furnishing materials for use in construction work on instrumentalities
of commerce.

(b) Utilities which serve production establishments. The Act applies to employees of public utilities which
furnish gas, electricity, water or fuel to firms engaged within the same State in manufacturing, processing,
producing, or mining goods for commerce.19 Construction work performed upon the plant and facilities of such a
utility is covered as in the case of any other covered production establishment.20 The extension of the lines or other
facilities of a covered utility for the first time to the premises of an establishment which produces goods for
commerce would be subject to the Act, because such extension is simply an improvement or enlargement of an
existing covered utility.21 Furthermore, the maintenance or repair of the wires, pipes, or other conduits of a covered
utility which serves business and manufacturing as well as residential areas would also be within the Act. On the
other hand, extension or repair of lines or other facilities serving only residential areas would not be covered unless
the electricity, gas, fuel, or water comes from out of the State.

(c) New construction which is not integrated with existing production facilities. (1) Construction of a new
factory building, even though its use for interstate production upon completion may be contemplated, will not
ordinarily be considered covered. However, if the new building is designed as a replacement of or an addition or an
improvement to, an existing interstate production facility, its construction will be considered subject to the Act.
(2) If the new building, though not physically attached to an existing plant which produces goods for
commerce, is designed to be an integral part of the improved, expanded or enlarged plant, the construction, like
maintenance and repair, it would be subject to the Act.22
Walling v. McCrady Const. Co., ante.

22

(d) Production of materials for use in construction work on interstate instrumentalities. (1) The Act applies to
employees who are engaged, at the job site or away from it, in the production of goods to be used within the State
for the maintenance, repair, extension, enlargement, improvement, replacement or reconstruction of an
instrumentality of interstate commerce. The goods need not go out of the State since the Act applies to the
production of goods “for” commerce, including for use in commerce, and is not limited to “production of goods for
transportation in commerce,” that is, to be sent across State lines.23

Asphalt Products Co., 222 F. (2) 913 (C.A. 6).

(2) The Act would also apply to the production of such items as electricity, fuel or water, for use in the
operation of railroads or other instrumentalities of commerce.24 Therefore, as in the case of other production units,
the maintenance, repair or other improvement of the premises or buildings or the appurtenances, including the
machinery, tools and dies and equipment, of the facilities which are used to produce such goods, are subject to the
Act.
Sections 776.19(b)(2) and 776.21. See also paragraph (b) of this section.

24

(3) Coverage also extends to employees who produce sand, gravel, asphalt, cement, crushed rock, railroad ties,
pipes, conduits, wires, concrete pilings and other materials which are to be used in the construction of
instrumentalities which serve as the means for the interstate movement of goods or persons.
(4) This does not mean, however, that in every case where employees produce such materials which are used
within the State in the maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of an instrumentality of commerce, the production of
such materials is necessarily considered as production “for” commerce. A material supply company may be engaged
in an independent business which is essentially local in nature, selling its materials to the usual miscellany of local
customers without any particular intent or purpose of supplying materials for the maintenance, repair, or
reconstruction of instrumentalities of commerce, and without any substantial portion of its business being directed to
such specific uses. Employees of such an “essentially local business” are not covered by the Act merely because as
an incident to its essentially local business, the company, on occasion, happens to produce or supply some materials
which are used within the State to meet the needs of instrumentalities of commerce.25
See §§776.19 (a) and (b) and 776.21(b)(3). See also cases cited in footnote 22 of this subpart.

§776.28 Covered preparatory activities.
(a) Before production begins. (1) The United States Supreme Court has held that the Act is applicable to
employees of a company which was engaged in preliminary oil well drilling, even though the holes were drilled to a
specified depth which was short of where the oil was expected to be found.26 The Act would also apply to drilling
operations even though no oil was discovered.27 Laborers employed in erecting drilling rigs would also be covered.28
Other preparatory work before drilling begins in an oil field, such as staking oil claims, surveying, clearing the land,
assembling materials and equipment, erecting sheds, derricks or dikes would also be within the scope of the Act.29
Preliminary work such as the foregoing has the requisite close and immediate tie with the production of goods for
commerce to be within the coverage of the Act.

(2) Similarly, coverage extends to employees engaged in the installation of machinery to be used in covered
production in a new factory building, even though the construction of the building itself may not have been subject
to the Act. Such installation is considered to be a preliminary production activity rather than simply part of the
construction of the building.
(3) If the construction project is subject to the Act, preliminary activities, such as surveying, clearing, draining
and leveling the land, erecting necessary buildings to house materials and equipment, or the demolition of structures
in order to begin building the covered facility, are subject to the Act.30

Coverage of preparation of plans and designs is discussed in §776.19(b) (2).

30

(b) Facilities used in aid of the covered construction. The installation of facilities, and the repair and
maintenance of trucks, tools, machinery and other equipment to be used by a contractor in the furtherance of his
covered construction work, are activities subject to the Act.
§776.29 Instrumentalities and channels of interstate commerce.
(a) Typical examples. Instrumentalities and channels which serve as the media for the movement of goods and
persons in interstate commerce or for interstate communications include railroads, highways, city streets; telephone,
gas, electric and pipe line systems; radio and television broadcasting facilities; rivers, canals and other waterways;
airports; railroad, bus, truck or steamship terminals; freight depots, bridges, ferries, bays, harbors, docks, wharves,
piers; ships, vehicles and aircraft which are regularly used in interstate commerce.31
31

General coverage bulletin, §776.11.

(b) General character of an instrumentality of interstate commerce. (1) An instrumentality of interstate
commerce need not stretch across State lines but may operate within a particular State as a link in a chain or system
of conduits through which interstate commerce moves.32 Obvious examples of such facilities are railroad terminals,
airports which are components of a system of air transportation, bridges and canals. A facility may be used for both
interstate and intrastate commerce but when it is so used it is nonetheless an interstate instrumentality. Such double
use does not exclude construction employees from being engaged in commerce.

Missouri Tel. Co., 115 F. (2d) 563 (C.A. 8).

(2) The term instrumentality of interstate commerce may refer to one unit or the entire chain of facilities. An
instrumentality such as a railroad constitutes a system or network of facilities by which the interstate movement of
goods and persons is accomplished. Each segment of the network is integrally connected with the whole and must be
viewed as part of the system as a whole, not as an isolated local unit.
(3) A construction project which changes the interstate system as a whole, or any of its units, would have a
direct bearing on the flow of interstate commerce throughout the network. Thus, the new construction of an alternate
route or an additional unit which alters the system or any segment of it, would have such a direct and vital
relationship to the functioning of the instrumentality of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of
such commerce rather than isolated local activity. For example, such construction as the maintenance, repair,
replacement, expansion, enlargement, extension, reconstruction, redesigning, or other improvement, of a railroad
system as a whole, or of any part of it, would have a close and intimate relationship with the movement of goods and
persons across State lines. All such construction, therefore, is subject to the Act.
(4) The same would be true with respect to other systems of interstate transportation or communication such
as roads, waterways, airports, pipe, gas and electric lines, and ship, bus, truck, telephone and broadcasting facilities.
Consequently, construction projects for lengthening, widening, deepening, relocating, redesigning, replacing and
adding new, substitute or alternate facilities; shortening or straightening routes or lines; providing cutoffs, tunnels,
trestles, causeways, overpasses, underpasses and bypasses are subject to the Act. Furthermore, the fact that such
construction serves another purpose as well as the improvement of the interstate facility, or that the improvement to
the interstate facility was incidental to other non-covered work, would not exclude it from the Act's coverage.33

Corp., 94 F. Supp. 197.

(c) Examples of construction projects which are subject to the Act. Coverage extends to employees who are
engaged on such work as repairing or replacing abutments and superstructures on a washed out railroad bridge;34

replacing an old highway bridge with a new one at a different location;35 removing an old railroad bridge and
partially rebuilding a new one; repairing a railroad roundhouse, signal tower, and storage building; relocating
portions of a county road; erecting new bridges with new approaches in different locations from the old ones;
widening a city street; relocating, improving or extending interstate telephone facilities including the addition of
new conduits and new trunk lines.36 Also within the scope of the Act are employees who are engaged in the
construction, maintenance and repair of ships, barges and other vessels used for interstate commerce, including
those belonging to the Government,37 and facilities used in the production and transmission of electric, fuel, water,
steam and other powers to instrumentalities of interstate commerce.38

(d) Construction of new facilities. (1) In a case before the United States Supreme Court, the question was
presented whether the Act applied to the construction of a new canal at some distance from the one then in use. The
new canal was to be an alternate route for entering the Mississippi River and would relieve traffic congestion in the
existing canal. The latter would continue in operation but could not be widened because of its location in a highly
developed industrial section of New Orleans. The Court in holding the construction of the new canal to be within the
coverage of the Act stated that the new construction was as intimately related to the improvement of navigation on
the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway as dredging in the existing canal would be and that the project was “part of the
redesigning of an existing facility of interstate commerce.”39 Thus the construction of a new facility in a network of
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in order to serve the system, or to function as an alternate route, or to
relieve traffic congestion in another unit, or to replace an outmoded facility, is subject to the Act.
Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante; see also Bennett v. V. P. Loftis, ante.

39

(2) Similarly, the construction of a new unit, such as a new airport which is an addition to the entire interstate
system of air transportation although not physically attached to any other unit, would, as a practical matter,
necessarily expand, promote and facilitate the movement of interstate commerce over the airway system, and
consequently, would be subject to the Act. In such a situation the interstate system, although composed of physically
separate local units, is, as a whole, the instrumentality of commerce which is improved. In most cases such an
addition would also directly enhance, improve or replace some particular nearby unit in the interstate network. The
new addition would thus relieve traffic congestion and facilitate the interstate movement of commerce over the
existing instrumentality as a whole, as well as at the particular nearby units. The same principle would apply to
highways, turnpikes and similar systems of interstate facilities.
(3) In like manner, the reconstruction, extension or expansion of a small unit in a system of interstate facilities,
such as the enlargement of a small airport which is regularly used for interstate travel or transportation, is covered,
regardless of the relative sizes of the original unit and the new one. The construction in such situations facilitates
and improves the interstate commerce served by, and is directly related to the continued, efficient and effective
operation of, both the particular original unit and the interstate system as a whole. Also, the construction of facilities
such as hangars, repair shops and the like at a covered airport, which are “directly and vitally related to the
functioning” of the instrumentality of commerce, would be subject to the Act.40
Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante.

(e) Construction on waterways. Courts have consistently held that the engagement in interstate commerce
includes the maintenance, repair or improvement of navigable waterways even when the construction work is
performed on the non-navigable parts of the instrumentality such as at the headwaters and watersheds or in tributary
streams.41
41
Tobin v. Pennington-Winter Const. Co., ante; Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co., ante; United States v. Appalachian Power Co.,
311 U.S. 426.

Construction which improves rivers and waterways serving as instrumentalities of interstate commerce includes
dredging; the building, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconstruction, improvement, or enlargement of dikes,
revetments, levees, harbor facilities, retaining walls, channels, berths, piers, wharves, canals, dams, reservoirs and
similar projects; also the removal of debris and other impediments in the waterway and flood control work in
general.42

F. (2d) 334.
42

The Act applies to construction work which increases the navigability of a waterway, protects it from floods or
otherwise improves or maintains its use as an instrumentality of interstate commerce. The courts have held that a
program for controlling floods is inseparably related to the stabilization and maintenance of the navigable channel of
the river, since levees, dams, dikes and like structures, which hold back the waters in time of flood, at the same time
confine a more efficient body of water during other periods by increasing its velocity and scouring and deepening its
channels.43

Hughes Construction Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 346 U.S. 925; Jackson v. U.S., 230 U.S. 1.

(1) Flood control work in non-navigable parts of a waterway. Both Congress and the courts have considered
that watersheds and headwaters are keys to the control of floods on navigable streams and that the control over the
non-navigable parts of a river is essential for the prevention of overflows on the navigable portions. It is also well
settled that in order to control floods on a navigable stream it is necessary to take flood control measures on its
tributaries.
(2) Basis of coverage. (i) The construction of a levee, dam or other improvement in any part of a river or its
tributaries for the purpose of preventing floods or aiding navigation must be considered as an integral part of a single
comprehensive project for improvement of the river system. Even though a particular levee or dike, by itself, may
not effect an improvement, the courts have made it clear that the combined effect of a chain of such structures serves
as the basis for determining coverage. The construction of a particular river structure may, therefore, be subject to
the Act simply because it is part of a comprehensive system of structures, whose combined effect will achieve the
improvement of the navigable channel. Thus, it has been held that site clearance work in the construction of a
multiple-purpose dam on a non-navigable stream is covered by the Act where the work is an integral part of a
comprehensive system for the control of floods and the betterment of navigation on the Arkansas and Mississippi
Rivers.44 Similarly, the enlargement of a set-back levee, located from two to six miles from the banks of the
Mississippi, was held to be covered because it was part of the Mississippi levee system even though the set-back
levee, when viewed separately, was not directly related to the functioning of the Mississippi as an instrumentality of
commerce.45

Construction Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 346 U.S. 925.
45

(ii) The principle involved applies also to other instrumentalities of interstate commerce. As in the case of
covered waterway projects, individual additions or improvements to other instrumentalities of interstate commerce
may for coverage purposes be considered as part of a whole program rather than separately. The Act will apply to

the construction in such situations if the unit, considered by itself or as part of a larger program, promotes the
efficient or effective operation of the instrumentality of interstate commerce.
(3) Construction of wharves, piers and docks. The Act also applies to the construction of new piers, wharves,
docks and other facilities if they are integrated with the interstate commerce functions of an existing harbor.
Similarly, the new construction of such facilities in other locations along the waterway is subject to the Act if they
are regularly used by vessels carrying goods or persons in interstate commerce.
(f) Highways, county roads and city streets—(1) Typical examples. As a generic term highways includes
bridges, underpasses, overpasses, bypasses, county roads, access roads, city streets and alternate roads, draw
bridges, toll bridges, toll roads and turnpikes, but does not include roads or parking facilities on privately owned
land and which are not for use by the general public for interstate traffic.
(2) Basis of coverage. The general rules for determining the coverage of employees engaged in the
construction of other instrumentalities of interstate commerce apply to highway construction work. The United
States Supreme Court has stated that in applying the Act to highway construction as to other coverage problems,
practical rather than technical constructions are decisive.46 After the Court remanded the Overstreet case to the
district court, the latter held that the employees engaged in maintaining and repairing the facilities regularly used
and available for interstate commerce were engaged in commerce, regardless of the extent of the interstate traffic.47
The court recognized that although the amount of the interstate commerce in the Overstreet case was very small it
was regular and recurring and not occasional nor incidental. Thus, under the authoritative decision a percentage test
is not regarded as a practical guide for ascertaining whether a particular facility is an instrumentality of interstate
commerce.48 Employees who are engaged in the repair, maintenance, extension, enlargement, replacement,
reconstruction, redesigning or other improvement of such a road are subject to the Act. The fact that the road is
owned or controlled by the State or Federal Government or by any subdivision thereof would not affect the
applicability of the Act. The same would be true if State or Federal funds were used to finance the construction. It
should be noted, however, that if the employees are actually employees of a State, or a political subdivision thereof,
they are excepted from coverage of the Act under section 3(d).

(3) City streets. The construction, reconstruction or repair of a city street, whether residential or not, which is
part of an interstate highway or which directly connects with any interstate highway is so closely related to the
interstate commerce moving on the existing highway as to be a part of it. Construction of other streets, which are not
a part of a public road building program and are constructed on private property as a part of a new residential
development, will not be considered covered until further clarification from the courts.
(4) New highway construction. Although a number of appellate court decisions have held that the construction
of new highways is not within the coverage of the Act, these decisions relied upon the technical “new construction”
concept which the United States Supreme Court has subsequently held to be inapplicable as the basis for
determining coverage under this Act.49 Under the principles now established by that Court's decision, which require
determination of coverage on the basis of realistic, practical considerations, the construction of new expressways
and highways that will connect with an interstate highway system is so “related to the functioning of an
instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, rather than isolated, local
activity.”50 Such highways and expressways not only are so designed as necessarily to become a part of or additions
to an existing interstate highway system, but their construction is plainly of a national rather than a local character,
as evidenced by the Federal financial contribution to their construction. And neither the fact that they are not
dedicated to interstate use during their construction, nor the fact that they will constitute alternate routes rather than
replacement of existing road, constitute sufficient basis, under the controlling court decisions, for excluding them

from the coverage of the Act.51 Accordingly, unless and until authoritative court decision in the future hold
otherwise, the construction of such new highways and expressways will be regarded as covered.

§776.30 Construction performed on temporarily idle facilities.
The Act applies to work on a covered interstate instrumentality or production facility even though performed
during periods of temporary non-use or idleness.52 The courts have held the Act applicable to performance of
construction work upon a covered facility even though the use of the facility was temporarily interrupted or
discontinued.53 It is equally clear that the repair or maintenance of a covered facility (including its machinery, tools,
dies, and other equipment) though performed during the inactive or dead season, is subject to the Acts.54
